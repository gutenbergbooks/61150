<p>On entering a building, almost the first thing that meets the eye is
the staircase and unconsciously it is made to serve as an indicator
of the quality of the architecture. If the design is poor or the
construction faulty, this flaw immediately gives the visitor a bad
impression of the whole building. Furthermore, stair-building is a
rather difficult subject and the principles involved are very little
understood, which is evidenced by the fact that the layouts as
furnished by architects in their plans are often improperly done.</p>

<p>Probably more mistakes occur in connection with the stairway of a
building than with any other construction feature. It is with the idea,
therefore, of giving a complete though simple presentation of the
construction methods as applied to standard design of staircases, that
this book has been prepared.</p>

<p>The article discusses straight and winding stairs, stairs with well
hole, layouts for curved turns, the proper proportions of rise and
width of tread, the design of hand railings and many other problems,
the solution of which will be found very useful.</p>

<p>Coupled with this article is a most instructive section on the Steel
Square, containing many applications of this useful instrument to roof
and other types of construction.</p>

<h2>PART I<br />STAIR-BUILDING</h2></div>

<p class="f110_left"><b>Introductory.</b></p>
<p>In the following instructions in the art of
Stair-building, it is the intention to adhere closely to the practical
phases of the subject, and to present only such matter as will directly
aid the student in acquiring a practical mastery of the art.</p>

<p>Stair-building, though one of the most important subjects connected
with the art of building, is probably the subject least understood by
designers and by workmen generally. In but few of the plans that leave
the offices of Architects, are the stairs properly laid down; and
many of the books that have been sent out for the purpose of giving
instruction in the art of building, have this common defect—that the
body of the stairs is laid down imperfectly, and therefore presents
great difficulties in the construction of the rail.</p>

<p>The stairs are an important feature of a building. On entering a
house they are usually the first object to meet the eye and claim
the attention. If one sees an ugly staircase, it will, in a measure,
condemn the whole house, for the first impression produced will seldom
be totally eradicated by commendable features that may be noted
elsewhere. It is extremely important, therefore, that both designer and
workman shall see that staircases are properly laid out.</p>

<p>Stairways should be commodious to ascend—inviting people, as it were,
to go up. When winders are used, they should extend past the spring
line of the cylinder, so as to give proper width at the narrow end
(<a href="#I_FIG_72">see Fig. 72</a>) and bring the rail there as nearly as possible
to the same pitch or slant as the rail over the square steps. When the hall is of
sufficient width, the stairway should not be less than four feet wide,
so that two people can conveniently pass each other thereon. The height
of riser and width of tread are governed by the staircase, which is
the space allowed for the stairway; but, as a general rule, the tread
should not be less than nine inches wide, and the riser should not be
over eight inches high. Seven-inch riser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> and eleven-inch tread will
make an easy stepping stairway. If you increase the width of the tread,
you must reduce the height of the riser. The tread and riser together
should not be over eighteen inches, and not less than seventeen inches.
These dimensions, however, cannot always be adhered to, as conditions
will often compel a deviation from the rule; for instance, in large
buildings, such as hotels, railway depots, or other public buildings,
treads are often made 18 inches wide, having risers of from 2½ inches
to 5 inches depth.</p>

<div><a name="DEFINITIONS" id="DEFINITIONS"></a>
<h4>Definitions.</h4></div>

<p>Before proceeding further with the subject, it is
essential that the student make himself familiar with a few of the
terms used in stair-building.</p>

<div class="figleft">
    <a name="I_FIG_1" id="I_FIG_1"></a>
    <img src="images/pt1-fig1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="147" />
    <p class="center">Fig. 1. Illustrating Rise, Run,<br />and Pitch.</p>
</div>

<p>The term <i>rise and run</i> is often used, and indicates certain dimensions
of the stairway. <a href="#I_FIG_1">Fig. 1</a> will illustrate exactly what is meant;
the line <i>A B</i> shows the <i>run</i>, or the length over the floor the stairs will
occupy. From <i>B</i> to <i>C</i> is the rise, or the total height from <i>top</i> of
lower floor to <i>top</i> of upper floor.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The line <i>D</i> is the <i>pitch</i> or <i>line of nosings</i>, showing the angle
of inclination of the stairs. On the three lines shown—the <i>run</i>, the
<i>rise</i>, and the <i>pitch</i>—depends the whole system of stair-building.</p>

<p>The <i>body</i> or <i>staircase</i> is the room or space in which the stairway
is contained. This may be a space including the width and length of
the stairway only, in which case it is called a <i>close stairway</i>, no
rail or baluster being necessary. Or the stairway may be in a large
apartment, such as a passage or hall, or even in a large room, openings
being left in the upper floors so as to allow road room for persons
on the stairway, and to furnish communication between the stairways and the different stories
of the building. In such cases we have what are known as <i>open stairways</i>,
from the fact that they are not closed on both sides, the steps showing
their ends at one side, while on the other side they are generally
placed against the wall.</p>

<p>Sometimes stairways are left open on both sides, a practice not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
uncommon in hotels, public halls, and steamships. When such stairs are
employed, the openings in the upper floor should be well <i>trimmed</i> with
joists or beams somewhat stronger than the ordinary joists used in the
same floor, as will be explained further on.</p>

<p><i>Tread.</i> This is the horizontal, upper surface of the step, upon which
the foot is placed. In other words, it is the piece of material that
forms the step, and is generally from 1¼ to 3 inches thick, and made of
a width and length to suit the position for which it is intended. In
small houses, the treads are usually made of ⅞-inch stuff.</p>

<p><i>Riser.</i> This is the vertical height of the step. The riser is
generally made of thinner stuff than the tread, and, as a rule, is not
so heavy. Its duty is to connect the treads together, and to give the
stairs strength and solidity.</p>

<p><i>Rise and Run.</i> This term, as already explained, is used to indicate
the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the stairway, the <i>rise</i>
meaning the height from the top of the lower floor to the top of the
second floor; and the <i>run</i> meaning the horizontal distance from the
face of the first riser to the face of the last or top riser, or, in
other words, the distance between the face of the first riser and the
point where a plumb line from the face of the top riser would strike
the floor. It is, in fact, simply the distance that the treads would
make if put side by side and measured together—without, of course,
taking in the nosings.</p>

<p>Suppose there are fifteen treads, each being 11 inches wide; this
would make a run of 15 × 11 = 165 inches = 13 feet 9 inches. Sometimes
this distance is called the <i>going</i> of the stair; this, however, is
an English term, seldom used in America, and when used, refers as
frequently to the length of the single tread as it does to the <i>run</i> of
the stairway.</p>

<p><i>String-Board.</i> This is the board forming the side of the stairway,
connecting with, and supporting the ends of the steps. Where the steps
are <i>housed</i>, or grooved into the board, it is known by the term
<i>housed string</i>; and when it is cut through for the tread to rest upon,
and is mitered to the riser, it is known by the term <i>cut and mitered string</i>.
The dimensions of the lumber generally used for the purpose
in practical work, are 9½ inches width and ⅞-inch thickness. In the
first-class stairways the thickness is usually 1⅛ inches, for both
front and wall strings.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<a href="#I_FIG_2">Fig. 2</a> shows the manner in which most stair-builders put their risers
and treads together. <i>T</i> and <i>T</i> show the treads; <i>R</i> and <i>R</i>, the
risers; <i>S</i> and <i>S</i>, the string; <i>O</i> and <i>O</i>, the cove mouldings under
the nosings <i>X</i> and <i>X</i>. <i>B</i> and <i>B</i> show the blocks that hold the
treads and risers together; these blocks should be from 4 to 6 inches
long, and made of very dry wood; their section may be from 1 to 2
inches square. On a tread 3 feet long, three of these blocks should be
used at about equal distances apart, putting the two outside ones about
6 inches from the strings. They are glued up tight into the angle.
First warm the blocks; next coat two adjoining sides with good, strong
glue; then put them in position, and nail them firmly to both tread
and riser. It will be noticed that the riser has a lip on the upper
edge, which enters into a groove in the tread. This lip is generally
about ⅜-inch long, and may be ⅜-inch or ½-inch in thickness. Care must
be taken in getting out the risers, that they shall not be made too
narrow, as allowance must be made for the lip.</p>

<p>If the riser is a little too wide, this will do no harm, as the
over-width may hang down below the tread; but it must be cut the exact
width where it rests on the string. The treads must be made the exact
width required, before they are grooved or have the nosing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
worked on
the outer edge. The lip or tongue on the riser should fit snugly in the
groove, and should <i>bottom</i>. By following these last instructions and
seeing that the <i>blocks</i> are well glued in, a good solid job will be
the result.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_3">Fig. 3</a> is a vertical section of stair steps in which the risers are
shown tongued into the under side of the tread, as in <a href="#I_FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>, and also
the tread tongued into the face of the riser. This last method is in
general use throughout the country. The stair-builder, when he has
steps of this kind to construct, needs to be very careful to secure
the exact width for tread and riser, including the tongue on each.
The usual method, in getting the parts prepared, is to make a pattern
showing the end section of each. The millman, with these patterns to
guide him, will be able to run the material through the machine without
any danger of leaving it either too wide or too narrow; while, if he is
left to himself without patterns, he is liable to make mistakes. These
patterns are illustrated in <a href="#I_FIG_4_5">Figs. 4 and 5</a> respectively,
and, as shown, are merely end sections of riser and tread.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_8">Fig. 8</a> shows a portion of a cut and mitered string, which will
give an excellent idea of the method of construction. The letter <i>O</i> shows the

These brackets are about <small><sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub></small>-inch thick, and are <i>planted</i>
(nailed) on the string; the brackets miter with the ends of the risers;
the ends of the brackets which miter with the risers, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> to be the
same height as the riser. The lower ends of two balusters are shown at
<i>G G</i>; and the dovetails or mortises to receive these are shown at <i>E

there are sometimes instances in which three are used, while in others
only one baluster is made use of.</p>

<p>An end portion of a cut and mitered string is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>,

shown at <i>D</i>, to support the tread. The balusters are shown dovetailed
into the ends of the treads, and are either glued or nailed in place,

 when the whole is ready for use. The method of using

<p><b>Strings.</b> There are two main kinds of stair strings—<i>wall
strings</i> and <i>cut strings</i>. These are divided, again, under other
names, as <i>housed</i> strings, <i>notched</i> strings, <i>staved</i> strings, and
<i>rough</i> strings.</p>

<p><i>Wall strings</i> are the supporters of the ends of the treads and
risers that are against the wall; these strings may be at both ends
of the treads and risers, or they may be at one end only. They may be
<i>housed</i> (grooved) or left solid. When housed, the treads and risers
are keyed into them, and glued and blocked. When left solid, they
have a rough string or carriage spiked or screwed to them, to lend
additional support to the ends of risers and treads. Stairs made after
this fashion are generally of a rough, strong kind, and are especially
adapted for use in factories, shops, and warehouses, where strength and
rigidity are of more importance than mere external appearance.</p>

<p><i>Open strings</i> are outside strings or supports, and are cut to the
proper angles for receiving the ends of the treads and risers. It
is over a string of this sort that the rail and balusters range; it
is also on such a string that all nosings return; hence, in some
localities, an open string is known as a <i>return string</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Housed strings</i> are those that have grooves cut in them to receive
the ends of treads and risers. As a general thing, wall strings are
housed. The housings are made from ⅝ to ¾ inch deep, and the lines at
top of tread and face of riser are made to correspond with the lines of
riser and tread when in position. The back lines of the housings are so
located that a taper wedge may be driven in so as to force the tread
and riser close to the face shoulders, thus making a tight joint.</p>

<p><i>Rough strings</i> are cut from undressed plank, and are used for
strengthening the stairs. Sometimes a combination of rough-cut strings
is used for circular or geometrical stairs, and, when framed together,
forms the support or carriage of the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<i>Staved strings</i> are built up strings, and are composed of narrow
pieces glued, nailed, or bolted together so as to form a portion of
a cylinder. These are sometimes used for circular stairs, though in
ordinary practice the circular part of a string is a part of the main
string bent around a cylinder to give it the right curve.</p>

<p><i>Notched strings</i> are strings that carry only treads. They are
generally somewhat narrower than the treads, and are housed across
their entire width. A sample of this kind of string is the side of a
common step-ladder. Strings of this sort are used chiefly in cellars,
or for steps intended for similar purposes.</p>

<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The measure for the rise of a stairway must
always be taken from the <i>top</i> of one floor to the <i>top</i> of the next.</p></div>

<div><a name="SETTING_OUT" id="SETTING_OUT"></a>
<h4>Setting Out Stairs.</h4></div>

<p>In setting out stairs, the first thing to
do is to ascertain the locations of the first and last risers, with
the height of the story wherein the stair is to be placed. These
points should be marked out, and the distance between them divided off
equally, giving the number of steps or treads required. Suppose we have
between these two points 15 feet, or 180 inches. If we make our treads
10 inches wide, we shall have 18 treads. It must be remembered that
<i>the number of risers is always one more than the number of treads</i>,
so that in the case before us there will be 19 risers.</p>

<p>The height of the story is next to be exactly determined, being taken
on a rod. Then, assuming a height of riser suitable to the place, we
ascertain, by division, how often this height of riser is contained in
the height of the story; the quotient, if there is no remainder, will
be the number of risers in the story. Should there be a remainder on
the first division, the operation is reversed, the number of inches
in the height being made the dividend, and the before-found quotient,
the divisor. The resulting quotient will indicate an amount to be
added to the former assumed height of riser for a new trial height.
The remainder will now be less than in the former division; and if
necessary, the operation of reduction by division is repeated, until
the height of the riser is obtained to the thirty-second part of an
inch. These heights are then set off on the story rod as exactly as
possible.</p>

<p>The <i>story rod</i> is simply a dressed or planed pole, cut to a length
exactly corresponding to the height from the top of the lower floor to
the top of the next floor. Let us suppose this height to be 11 feet 1
inch, or 133 inches. Now, we have 19 risers to place in this space, to
enable us to get upstairs; therefore, if we divide 133 by 19, we get 7
without any remainder. Seven inches will therefore be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> width or
height of the riser. Without figuring this out, the workman may find
the exact width of the riser by dividing his story rod, by means of
pointers, into 19 equal parts, any one part being the proper width.
It may be well, at this point, to remember that <i>the first riser must
always be narrower than the others</i>, because the thickness of the first
tread must be taken off.</p>

<p>The width of treads may also be found without figuring, by pointing
off the <i>run</i> of the stairs into the required number of parts; though,
where the student is qualified, it is always better to obtain the
width, both of treads and of risers, by the simple arithmetical rules.</p>

<p>Having determined the width of treads and risers, a <i>pitch-board</i>
should be formed, showing the angle of inclination. This is done by
cutting a piece of thin board or metal in the shape of a right-angled
triangle, with its base exactly equal to the run of the step, and its
perpendicular equal to the height of the riser. It is a general maxim,
that the greater the breadth of a step or tread, the less should be the
height of the riser; and, conversely, the less the breadth of a step,
the greater should be the height of the riser. The proper relative
dimensions of treads and risers may be illustrated graphically, as in
<a href="#I_FIG_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 12. Graphic Illustration of Proportional
                    Dimensions of Treads and Risers.</p>
</div>

<p>In the right-angle triangle <i>A B C</i>, make <i>A B</i> equal to 24 inches,
and <i>B C</i> equal to 11 inches—the standard proportion. Now, to find
the riser corresponding to a given width of tread, from <i>B</i>, set off
on <i>A B</i> the width of the tread, as <i>B D</i>; and from <i>D</i>, erect a
perpendicular <i>D E</i>, meeting the hypotenuse in <i>E</i>; then <i>D E</i> is the
height of the riser; and if we join <i>B</i> and <i>E</i>, the angle <i>D B E</i> is
the angle of inclination, showing the slope of the ascent. In like
manner, where <i>B F</i> is the width of the tread, <i>F G</i> is the riser, and
<i>B G</i> the slope of the stair. A width of tread <i>B H</i> gives a riser of
the height of <i>H K</i>; and a width of tread equal to <i>B L</i> gives a riser
equal to <i>L M</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>In the opinion of many builders, however, a better scheme of
proportions for treads and risers is obtained by the following method:</p>

<p>Set down two sets of numbers, each in arithmetical progression—the
first set showing widths of tread, increasing by inches; the other
showing heights of riser, decreasing by half-inches.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that each pair of treads and risers thus
obtained is suitably proportioned as to dimensions.</p>

<p>It is seldom, however, that the proportions of treads and risers are
entirely a matter of choice. The space allotted to the stairs usually
determines this proportion; but the above will be found a useful
standard, to which it is desirable to approximate.</p>

<p>In the better class of buildings, the number of steps is considered in
the plan, which it is the business of the Architect to arrange; and
in such cases, the height of the story rod is simply divided into the
number required.</p>

<div><a name="PITCH_BOARD" id="PITCH_BOARD"></a>
<h4>Pitch-Board.</h4></div>

<p>It will now be in order to describe a pitch-board
and the manner of using it; no stairs can be properly built without
the use of a pitch-board in some form or other. Properly speaking,
a pitch-board, as already explained, is a thin piece of material,
generally pine or sheet metal, and is a right-angled triangle in
outline. One of its sides is made the exact height of the rise; at
right angles with this line of rise, the exact width of the tread is
measured off; and the material is cut along the hypotenuse of the
right-angled triangle thus formed.</p>

<p>The simplest method of making a pitch-board is by using a steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
square, which, of course, every carpenter in this country is supposed to
possess. By means of this invaluable tool, also, a stair string can be
laid out, the square being applied to the string as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_13">Fig. 13</a>.
In the instance here illustrated, the square shows 10 inches for the
tread and 7 inches for the rise.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

                        in Laying Out Stair String.</p>
</div>

<p>To cut a pitch-board, after the tread and rise have been determined,
proceed as follows: Take a piece of thin, clear material, and lay the
square on the face edge, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_13">Fig. 13</a>. Mark out
the pitch-board with a sharp knife; then cut out with a fine saw, and dress to the
knife marks; nail a piece on the largest edge of the pitch-board for a
gauge or fence, and it is ready for use.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_14_16">Fig. 14</a> shows the pitch-board pure and simple;
it may be half an inch thick, or, if of hardwood, may be from a quarter-inch
to a half-inch thick.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_14_16">Fig. 15</a> shows the pitch-board after the gauge or fence
is nailed on. This fence or gauge may be about 1½ inches wide and from ⅜ to ¾ inch
thick.</p>

with a fence nailed on.</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_17">Fig. 17</a> the manner of applying the pitch-board is shown.
<i>R R R</i> is the string, and the line <i>A</i> shows the jointed or straight edge
of the string. The pitch-board <i>P</i> is shown in position, the line
8⅓ represents the step or tread, and the line 7¾ shows the line of
the riser. These two lines are of course at right angles, or, as the
carpenter would say; they are <i>square</i>. This string shows four complete
cuts, and part of a fifth cut for treads, and five complete cuts for
risers. The bottom of the string at <i>W</i> is cut off at the line of the
floor on which it is supposed to rest. The line <i>C</i> is the line of the
first riser. This riser is cut lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
than any of the other risers,
because, as above explained, the thickness of the first tread is always
taken off it; thus, if the tread is 1½ inches thick, the riser in this
case would only require to be 6¼ inches wide, as 7¾-1½ = 6¼.</p>

<p>The string must be cut so that the line at <i>W</i> will be only 6¼ inches
from the line at 8⅓, and these two lines must be parallel. The first
riser and tread having been satisfactorily dealt with, the rest can
easily be marked off by simply sliding the pitch-board along the line
<i>A</i> until the outer end of the line 8⅓ on the pitch-board strikes the
outer end of the line 7¾ on the string, when another tread and another
riser are to be marked off. The remaining risers and treads are marked
off in the same manner.</p>

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 17. Showing Method of Using Pitch-Board.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes there may be a little difficulty at the top of the stairs, in
fitting the string to the trimmer or joists; but, as it is necessary
first to become expert with the pitch-board, the method of trimming the
well or attaching the cylinder to the string will be left until other
matters have been discussed.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_18">Fig. 18</a> shows a portion of the stairs in position.
<i>S</i> and <i>S</i> show the strings, which in this case are cut square; that is,
the part of the string to which the riser is joined is cut square across, and the
butt or end wood of the riser is seen. In this case, also, the end of
the tread is cut square off, and flush with the string and riser. Both
strings in this instance are open strings. Usually, in stairs of this
kind, the ends of the treads are rounded off similarly to the front
of the tread, and the ends project over the strings the same distance
that the front edge projects over the riser. If a moulding or <i>cove</i>
is used under the nosing in front, it should be carried round on the
string to the back edge of the tread and cut off square, for in this
case the back edge of the tread will be square. A riser is shown at
<i>R</i>, and it will be noticed that it runs down behind the tread on the
back edge, and is either nailed or screwed to the tread. This is the
American practice, though in England the riser usually rests on the
tread, which extends clear back to string as shown at the top tread in
the diagram. It is much better, however, for general purposes, that the
riser go behind the tread, as this tends to make the whole stairway
much stronger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Housed strings are those which carry the treads and risers without
their ends being seen. In an open stair, the wall string only is
housed, the other ends of the treads and risers resting on a cut
string, and the nosings and mouldings being returned as before
described.</p>

<p>The manner of housing is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>, in which the
treads <i>T T</i> and the risers <i>R R</i> are shown in position, secured in place
respectively by means of wedges <i>X X</i> and <i>F F</i>, which should be well
covered with good glue before insertion in the groove. The housings are
generally made from ½ to ⅝ inch deep, space for the wedge being cut to suit.</p>

<p>In some closed stairs in which there is a housed string between the
newels, the string is double-tenoned into the shanks of both newels,
as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>. The string in this example is made
12¾ inches wide, which is a very good width for a string of this kind; but the
thickness should never be less than 1½ inches. The upper newel is made
about 5 feet 4 inches long from drop to top of cap. These strings are
generally capped with a subrail of some kind, on which the baluster, if
any, is cut-mitered in. Generally a groove, the width of the square of
the balusters, is worked on the top of the subrail, and the balusters
are worked out to fit into this groove; then pieces of this material,
made the width of the groove and a little thicker than the groove is
deep, are cut so as to fit in snugly between the ends of the balusters
resting in the groove. This makes a solid job; and the pieces between
the balusters may be made <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of any shape on top, either beveled, rounded,
or moulded, in which case much is added to the appearance of the stairs.</p>

any desirable pattern. The end next the riser should be mitered to
suit; this will require the riser to be ⅜ inch longer than the face of
the string. The upper part of the bracket should run under the cove
moulding; and the tread should project over the string the full ⅜ inch,
so as to cover the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>bracket and make the face even for the nosing and
the cove moulding to fit snugly against the end of the tread and the
face of the bracket. Great care must be taken about this point, or
endless trouble will follow. In a bracketed stair of this kind, care
must be taken in placing the newel posts, and provision must be made
for the extra ⅜ inch due to the bracket. The newel post must be set out
from the string ⅜ inch, and it will then align with the baluster.</p>

<p>We have now described several methods of dealing with strings; but
there are still a few other points connected with these members, both
housed and open, that it will be necessary to explain; before the young
workman can proceed to build a fair flight of stairs. The connection
of the wall string to the lower and upper floors, and the manner of
affixing the outer or cut string to the upper joist and to the newel,
are matters that must not be overlooked. It is the intention to show
how these things are accomplished, and how the stairs are made strong
by the addition of rough strings or bearing carriages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

</div>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_25">Fig. 25</a> gives a side view of part of a stair of the better
class, with one open, cut and mitered string. In <a href="#I_FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>, a plan
of this same stairway, <i>W S</i> shows the wall string; <i>R S</i>, the rough string,
placed there to give the structure strength; and <i>O S</i>, the outer or cut and
mitered string. At <i>A A</i> the ends of the risers are shown, and it will
be noticed that they are mitered against a vertical or riser line of
the string, thus preventing the end of the riser from being seen. The
other end of the riser is in the housing in the wall string. The outer
end of the tread is also mitered at the nosing, and a piece of material
made or worked like the nosing is mitered against or returned at the
end of the tread. The end of this returned piece is again returned on
itself back to the string, as shown at <i>N</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>.
The moulding, which is ⅝-inch cove in this case, is also returned on itself back to
the string.</p>

<p>The mortises shown at <i>B B B B</i> (<a href="#I_FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>), are for
the balusters. It is always the proper thing to saw the ends of the treads ready for
the balusters before the treads are attached to the string; then, when the
time arrives to put up the rail, the back ends of the mortises can be
cut out, when the treads will be ready to receive the balusters. The
mortises are dovetailed, and, of course, the tenons on the balusters
must be made to suit. The treads are finished on the bench; and the
return nosings are fitted to them and tacked on, so that they may
be taken off to insert the balusters when the rail is being put in position.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_27">Fig. 27</a> shows the manner in which a wall string is finished
at the foot of the stairs. <i>S</i> shows the string, with moulding wrought on the upper
edge. This moulding may be a simple ogee, or may consist of a number of
members; or it may be only a bead; or, again, the edge of the string
may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>left quite plain; this will be regulated in great measure by the
style of finish in the hall or other part of the house in which the
stairs are placed. <i>B</i> shows a portion of a baseboard, the top edge of
which has the same finish as the top edge of the string. <i>B</i> and <i>A</i>
together show the junction of the string and base. <i>F F</i> show blocks
glued in the angles of the steps to make them firm and solid.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_29">Fig. 29</a> shows a cut or open string at the foot of a stairway,
and the manner of dealing with it at its junction with the newel post <i>K</i>.
The point of the string should be mortised into the newel 2 inches,
3 inches, or 4 inches, as shown by the dotted lines; and the mortise
in the newel should be cut near the center, so that the center of
the baluster will be directly opposite the central line of the newel
post. The proper way to manage this, is to mark the central line of
the baluster on the tread, and then make this line correspond with the
central line of the newel post. By careful attention to this point,
much trouble will be avoided where a turned cap is used to receive the
lower part of the rail.</p>

<p>The lower riser in a stair of this kind will be somewhat shorter than
the ones above it, as it must be cut to fit between the newel and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the wall string. A portion of the tread, as well as of the riser, will also
butt against the newel, as shown at <i>W</i>.</p>

<p>If there is no spandrel or wall under the open string, it may run down
to the floor as shown by the dotted line at <i>O</i>. The piece <i>O</i> is glued
to the string, and the moulding is worked on the curve. If there is
a wall under the string <i>S</i>, then the base <i>B</i>, shown by the dotted
lines, will finish against the string, and it should have a moulding on
its upper edge, the same as that on the lower edge of the string, if
any, this moulding being mitered into the one on the string. When there
is a base, the piece <i>O</i> is of course dispensed with.</p>

<p>The square of the newel should run down by the side of a joist as
shown, and should be firmly secured to the joist either by spiking or
by some other suitable device. If the joist runs the other way, try
to get the newel post against it, if possible, either by furring out
the joist or by cutting a portion off the thickness of the newel. The
solidity of a stair and the firmness of the rail, depend very much upon
the rigidity of the newel post. The above suggestions are applicable
where great strength is required, as in public buildings. In ordinary
work, the usual method is to let the newel rest on the floor.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_30">Fig. 30</a> shows how the cut string is finished at the
top of the stairs. This illustration requires no explanation after the instructions
already given.</p>

<p>Thus far, stairs having a newel only at the bottom have been dealt
with. There are, however, many modifications of straight and return
stairs which have from two to four or six newels. In such cases, the
methods of treating strings at their finishing points must necessarily
be somewhat different from those described; but the general principles,
as shown and explained, will still hold good.</p>

<div><a name="WELL_HOLE" id="WELL_HOLE"></a>
<h4>Well-Hole.</h4></div>

<p>Before proceeding to describe and illustrate neweled
stairs, it will be proper to say something about the <i>well-hole</i>, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
opening through the floors, through which the traveler on the stairs
ascends or descends from one floor to another.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_31">Fig. 31</a> shows a well-hole, and the manner of trimming
it. In this instance the stairs are placed against the wall; but this is not
necessary in all cases, as the well-hole may be placed in any part of
the building.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the trimming varies according as the joists are at
right angles to, or are parallel to, the wall against which the stairs
are built. In the former case (<a href="#I_FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>, <i>A</i>) the joists
are cut short and tusk-tenoned into the heavy trimmer <i>T T</i>, as shown in the cut.
This trimmer is again tusk-tenoned into two heavy joists <i>T J</i> and <i>T
J</i>, which form the ends of the well-hole. These heavy joists are called
<i>trimming joists</i>; and, as they have to carry a much heavier load than
other joists on the same floor, they are made much heavier. Sometimes
two or three joists are placed together, side by side, being bolted
or spiked together to give them the desired unity and strength. In
constructions requiring great strength, the tail and header joists of a
well-hole are suspended on iron brackets.</p>

<p>If the opening runs parallel with the joists (<a href="#I_FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>, <i>B</i>),
the timber forming the side of the well-hole should be left a little heavier than
the other joists, as it will have to carry short trimmers (<i>T J</i> and
<i>T J</i>) and the joists running into them. The method here shown is more
particularly adapted to brick buildings, but there is no reason why the
same system may not be applied to frame buildings.</p>

<p>Usually in cheap, frame buildings, the trimmers <i>T T</i> are spiked
against the ends of the joists, and the ends of the trimmers are
supported by being spiked to the trimming joists <i>T J</i>, <i>T J</i>. This is
not very workmanlike or very secure, and should not be done, as it is
not nearly so strong or durable as the old method of framing the joists
and trimmers together.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_32">Fig. 32</a> shows a stair with three newels and a platform.
In this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>example, the first tread (No. 1) stands forward of the newel post
two-thirds of its width. This is not necessary in every case, but it is
sometimes done to suit conditions in the hallway. The second newel is
placed at the twelfth riser, and supports the upper end of the first
cut string and the lower end of the second cut string. The platform
(12) is supported by joists which are framed into the wall and are
fastened against a trimmer running from the wall to the newel along the
line 12. This is the case only when the second newel runs down to the floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="I_FIG_31" id="I_FIG_31"></a>
    <img src="images/pt1-fig31.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="544" />
    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 31. Showing Ways of Trimming Well-Hole
                                  when Joists Run in Different Directions.</p>
</div>

<p>If the second newel does not run to the floor, the framework supporting
the platform will need to be built on studding. The third newel stands
at the top of the stairs, and is fastened to the joists of the second
floor, or to the trimmer, somewhat after the manner of fastening shown
in <a href="#I_FIG_29">Fig. 29</a>. In this example, the stairs have 16 risers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>and
15 treads, the platform or landing (12) making one tread. The figure 16 shows the
floor in the second story.</p>

<p>This style of stair will require a well-hole in shape about as shown
in the plan; and where strength is required, the newel at the top
should run from floor to floor, and act as a support to the joists and
trimmers on which the second floor is laid.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way for a beginner to go about building a stairway
of this type, will be to lay out the work on the lower floor in the
exact place where the stairs are to be erected, making everything full
size. There will be no difficulty in doing this; and if the positions
of the first riser and the three newel posts are accurately defined,
the building of the stairs will be an easy matter. Plumb lines can be
raised from the lines on the floor, and the positions of the platform
and each riser thus easily determined. Not only is it best to line out
on the floor all stairs having more than one newel; but in constructing
any kind of stair it will perhaps be safest for a beginner to lay out
in exact position on the floor the points over which the treads and
risers will stand. By adopting this rule, and seeing that the strings,
risers, and treads correspond exactly with the lines on the floor,
many cases of annoyance will be avoided. Many expert stair-builders,
in fact, adopt this method in their practice, laying out all stairs on
the floor, including even the carriage strings, and they cut out all
the material from the lines obtained on the floor. By following this
method, one can see exactly the requirements in each particular case,
and can rectify any error without destroying valuable material.</p>

<a name="LAYING_OUT" id="LAYING_OUT"></a>
<h4>Laying Out.</h4></div>

<p>In order to afford the student a clear idea of what is meant by
<i>laying out</i> on the floor, an example of a simple close-string stair
is given. In <a href="#I_FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>, the letter <i>F</i> shows the floor line;
<i>L</i> is the landing or platform; and <i>W</i> is the wall line. The stair is to be 4
feet wide over strings; the landing, 4 feet wide; the height from floor
to landing, 7 feet; and the run from start to finish of the stair, 8
feet 8½ inches.</p>

<p>The first thing to determine is the dimensions of the treads and
risers. The wider the tread, the lower must be the riser, as stated
before. No definite dimensions for treads and risers can be given, as
the steps have to be arranged to meet the various difficulties that
may occur in the working out of the construction; but a common rule
is this: Make the width of the tread, plus twice the rise, equal to
24 inches. This will give, for an 8-inch tread, an 8-inch rise; for a
9-inch tread, a 7½-inch rise; for a 10-inch tread, a 7-inch rise, and
so on. Having the height (7 feet) and the run of the flight (8 feet
8½-inches), take a rod about one inch square, and mark on it the height
from floor to landing (7 feet), and the length of the going or run of
the flight (8 feet 8½ inches). Consider now what are the dimensions
which can be given to the treads and risers, remembering that there
will be one more riser than the number of treads. Mark off on the rod
the landing, forming the last tread. If twelve risers are desired,
divide the height (namely, 7 feet) by 12, which gives 7 inches as the
rise of each step. Then divide the run (namely, 8 feet 8½ inches) by
11, and the width of the tread is found to be 9½ inches.</p>

<p>Great care must be taken in making the pitch-board for marking off
the treads and risers on the string. The pitch-board may be made
from dry hardwood about ⅜-inch thick. One end and one side must be
perfectly square to each other; on the one, the width of the tread is
set off, and on the other the height of the riser. Connect the two
points thus obtained, and saw the wood on this line. The addition of a
gauge-piece along the longest side of the triangular piece, completes
the pitch-board, as was illustrated in <a href="#I_FIG_14_16">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>The length of the wall and outer string can be ascertained by means
of the pitch-board. One side and one edge of the wall string must be
squared; but the outer string must be trued all round. On the strings,
mark the positions of the treads and risers by using the pitch-board as
already explained (<a href="#I_FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>). Strings are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
made 11 inches wide, but may be made 12½ inches wide if necessary for strength.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="I_FIG_33" id="I_FIG_33"></a>
    <img src="images/pt1-fig33a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="408" />
    <img src="images/pt1-fig33b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="275" />
    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 33. Method of Laying Out a Simple, Close-String Stair.</p>
</div>

<p>After the widths of risers and treads have been determined, and the
string is ready to lay out, apply the pitch-board, marking the first
riser about 9 inches from the end; and number each step in succession.
The thickness of the treads and risers can be drawn by using thin
strips of hardwood made the width of the housing required. Now allow
for the wedges under the treads and behind the risers, and thus find
the exact width of the housing, which should be about ⅝-inch <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
deep; the
treads and risers will require to be made 1¼ inches longer than shown
in the plan, to allow for the housings at both ends.</p>

<p>Before putting the stair together, be sure that it can be taken into
the house and put in position without trouble. If for any reason it
cannot be put in after being put together, then the parts must be
assembled, wedged, and glued up at the spot.</p>

<p>It is essential in laying out a plan on the floor, that the exact
positions of the first and last risers be ascertained, and the height
of the story wherein the stair is to be placed. Then draw a plan of
the hall or other room in which the stairs will be located, including
surrounding or adjoining parts of the room to the extent of ten or
twelve feet from the place assigned for the foot of the stair. All
the doorways, branching passages, or windows which can possibly come
in contact with the stair from its commencement to its expected
termination or landing, must be noted. The sketch must necessarily
include a portion of the entrance hall in one part, and of the lobby
or landing in another, and on it must be laid out all the lines of the
stair from the first to the last riser.</p>

<p>The height of the story must next be exactly determined and taken on
the rod; then, assuming a height of risers suitable to the place,
a trial is made by division in the manner previously explained, to
ascertain how often this height is contained in the height of the
story. The quotient, if there is no remainder, will be the number of
risers required. Should there be a remainder on the first division,
the operation is reversed, the number of inches in the height being
made the dividend and the before-found quotient the divisor; and the
operation of reduction by division is carried on till the height of the
riser is obtained to the thirty-second part of an inch. These heights
are then set off as exactly as possible on the story rod, as
shown in <a href="#I_FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>.</p>

<p>The next operation is to show the risers on the sketch. This the
workman will find no trouble in arranging, and no arbitrary rule can
be given.</p>

<p>A part of the foregoing may appear to be repetition; but it is not, for
it must be remembered that scarcely any two flights of stairs are alike
in run, rise, or pitch, and any departure in any one dimension from
these conditions leads to a new series of dimensions that must be dealt
with independently. The principle laid down, however, applies to all
straight flights of stairs; and the student who has followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
closely and retained the pith of what has been said, will, if he has a fair
knowledge of the use of tools, be fairly equipped for laying out and
constructing a plain, straight stair with a straight rail.</p>

<p>Plain stairs may have one platform, or several; and they may turn to
the right or to the left, or, rising from a platform or landing, may
run in an opposite direction from their starting point.</p>

<p>When two flights are necessary for a story, it is desirable that each
flight should consist of the same number of steps; but this, of course,
will depend on the form of the staircase, the situation and height of
doors, and other obstacles to be passed under or over, as the case may be.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>, a stair is shown with a single platform or
landing and three newels. The first part of this stair corresponds, in number of
risers, with the stair shown in <a href="#I_FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>; the second newel
runs down to the floor, and helps to sustain the landing. This newel may simply
be a 4 by 4-inch post, or the whole space may be inclosed with the
spandrel of the stair. The second flight starts from the platform just
as the first flight starts from the lower floor, and both flights may
be attached to the newels in the manner shown in <a href="#I_FIG_29">Fig. 29</a>.
The bottom tread in <a href="#I_FIG_32">Fig. 32</a> is rounded off against the square
of the newel post; but this cannot well be if the stairs start from the landing, as the
tread would project too far onto the platform. Sometimes, in high-class
stairs, provision is made for the first tread to project well onto the landing.</p>

<p>If there are more platforms than one, the principles of construction
will be the same; so that whenever the student grasps the full
conditions governing the construction of a single-platform stair, he
will be prepared to lay out and construct the body of any stair having
one or more landings. The method of laying out, making, and setting up
a hand-rail will be described later.</p>

<p>Stairs formed with treads each of equal width at both ends, are named
<i>straight flights</i>; but stairs having treads wider at one end than the
other are known by various names, as <i>winding stairs</i>, <i>dog-legged
stairs</i>, <i>circular stairs</i>, or <i>elliptical stairs</i>. A tread with
parallel sides, having the same width at each end, is called a <i>flyer</i>;
while one having one wide end and one narrow, is called a <i>winder</i>.
These terms will often be made use of in what follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
The elevation and plan of the stair shown in <a href="#I_FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>
may be called a <i>dog-legged</i> stair with three winders and six flyers.
The flyers, however, may be extended to any number. The housed strings to
receive the winders are shown. These strings show exactly the manner of
construction. The shorter string, in the corner from 1 to 4, which is
shown in the plan to contain the housing of the first winder and half
of the second, is put up first, the treads being leveled by aid of a
spirit level; and the longer upper string is put in place afterwards,
butting snugly against the lower string in the corner. It is then
fastened firmly to the wall. The winders are cut snugly around the
newel post, and well nailed. Their risers will stand one above another
on the post; and the straight string above the winders will enter the

</div>

<p><i>Platform stairs</i> are often constructed so that one flight will run
in a direction opposite to that of the other flight, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_35">Fig.35</a>.
In cases of this kind, the landing or platform requires to have
a length more than double that of the treads, in order that both
flights may have the same width. Sometimes, however, and for various
reasons, the upper flight is made a little narrower than the lower; but
this expedient should be avoided whenever possible, as its adoption
unbalances the stairs. In the example before us, eleven treads, not
including the landing, run in one direction; while four treads,
including the landing, run in the opposite direction; or, as workmen
put it, the stair “returns on itself.” The elevation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>

<p>We may state that stairs should have <i>carriage pieces</i> fixed from floor

carriage, and carried under each riser and tread.</p>

<p>There is also a framed spandrel which helps materially to carry the
weight, makes a sound job, and adds greatly to the appearance. This
spandrel may be made of 1¼-inch material, with panels and mouldings
on the front side, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>. The joint between

<p>In setting out stairs, not only the proportions of treads and risers
must be considered, but also the material available. As this material
runs, as a rule, in certain sizes, it is best to work so as to conform
to it as nearly as possible. In ordinary stairs, 11 by 1-inch common
stock is used for strings and treads, and 7-inch by ¾-inch stock for
risers; in stairs of a better class, wider and thicker material may be
used. The rails are set at various heights; 2 feet 8 inches may be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
taken as an average height on the stairs, and 3 feet 1 inch on landings, with
two balusters to each step.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>, all the newels and balusters are shown square;
but it is much better, and is the more common practice, to have them turned, as
this gives the stairs a much more artistic appearance. The spandrel
under the string of the stairway shows a style in which many stairs are
finished in hallways and other similar places. Plaster is sometimes
used instead of the panel work, but is not nearly so good as woodwork.
The door under the landing may open into a closet, or may lead to a
cellarway, or through to some other room.</p>

<p>In stairs with winders, the width of a winder should, if possible,
be nearly the width of the regular tread, at a distance of 14 inches
from the narrow end, so that the length of the step in walking up
or down the stairs may not be interrupted; and for this reason and
several others, it is always best to have three winders only in each
quarter-turn. Above all, avoid a four-winder turn, as this makes a
breakneck stair, which is more difficult to construct and inconvenient to use.

<p><i>Bullnose Tread.</i> No other stair, perhaps, looks so well at the
starting point as one having a <i>bullnose</i> step. In <a href="#I_FIG_44">Fig. 44</a>
are shown a plan and elevation of a flight of stairs having a bullnose tread. The
method of obtaining the lines and setting out the body of the stairs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>is
the same as has already been explained for other stairs, with the
exception of the first two steps, which are made with circular ends,
as shown in the plan. These circular ends are worked out as hereafter
described, and are attached to the newel and string as shown. The
example shows an open, cut string with brackets. The spandrel under
the string contains short panels, and makes a very handsome finish.
The newels and balusters in this case are turned, and the latter have
cutwork panels between them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>

<h4>Open-Newel Stairs.</h4></div>

<p>Before leaving the subject of straight
and dog-legged stairs, the student should be made familiar with at
least one example of an open-newel stair. As the same principles of
construction govern all styles of open-newel stairs, a single example
will be sufficient. The student must, of course, understand that
he himself is the greatest factor in planning stairs of this type;
that the setting out and designing will generally devolve on him. By
exercising a little thought and foresight, he can so arrange his plan
that a minimum of both labor and material will be required.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_54">Fig. 54</a> shows a plan of an open-newel stair having two

The dotted lines show the carriage timbers and trimmers, also the lines of risers;
while the treads are shown by full lines. It will be noticed that the strings and
trimmers at the first landing are framed into the shank of the second

below the fascia, and has a turned and carved drop. This drop hangs
below both the fascia and the string. The lines of treads and risers
are shown by dotted lines and crosshatched sections. The position of
the carriage timbers is shown both in the landings and in the runs of
the stairs, the projecting ends of these timbers being supposed to be
resting on the wall. A scale of the plan and elevation is attached
to the plan. In <a href="#I_FIG_55">Fig. 55</a>, a story rod is shown at the

<p>Only the central carriage timbers are shown in <a href="#I_FIG_54">Fig. 54</a>;
but in a stair of this width, there ought to be two other timbers, not so heavy,
perhaps, as the central one, yet strong enough to be of service in
lending additional strength to the stairway, and also to help carry the
laths and plaster or the paneling which may be necessary in completing
the under side or soffit. The strings being closed, the butts of their

The first newel should pass through the lower floor, and, to insure
solidity, should be secured by bolts to a joist, as shown in the
elevation. The rail is attached to the newels in the usual manner, with
handrail bolts or other suitable device. The upper newel should be made
fast to the joists as shown, either by bolts or in some other efficient
manner. The intermediate newels are left square on the shank below the
stairs, and may be fastened in the floor below either by mortise and
tenon or by making use of joint bolts.</p>

<p>Sufficient examples of stairs having
angles of greater or less degree at the turn or change of direction, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
enable the student to build any stair of this class, have now been
given. There are, however, other types of stairs in common use, whose
turns are curved, and in which newels are employed only at the foot,
and sometimes at the finish of the flight. These curved turns may be
any part of a circle, according to the requirements of the case, but
turns of a quarter-circle or half-circle are the more common. The
string forming the curve is called a <i>cylinder</i>, or part of a cylinder,
as the case may be. The radius of this circle or cylinder may be any
length, according to the space assigned for the stair. The opening
around which the stair winds is called the <i>well-hole</i>.</p>

<div class="figright">

                     with Mid-Floor<br />Landing.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_56">Fig. 56</a> shows a portion of a stairway having a well-hole
with a 7-inch radius. This stair is rather peculiar, as it shows a quarter-space
landing, and a quarter-space having three winders. The reason for this
is the fact that the landing is on a level with the floor of another
room, into which a door opens from the landing. This is a problem very
often met with in practical work, where the main stair is often made
to do the work of two flights because of one floor being so much lower
than another.</p>

<p>A curved stair, sometimes called a <i>geometrical stair</i>, is shown in
<a href="#I_FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>, containing seven winders in the cylinder or
well-hole, the first and last aligning with the diameter.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_58">Fig. 58</a> is shown another example of this kind of stair,
containing nine winders in the well-hole, with a circular wall-string. It is not
often that stairs are built in this fashion, as most stairs having a
circular well-hole finish against the wall in a manner similar to that
shown in <a href="#I_FIG_57">Fig. 57</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft">

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 57. Geometrical Stair with<br />Seven Winders.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, however, the workman will be confronted with a plan such as
shown in <a href="#I_FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>; and he should know how to lay out the wall-string.
In the elevation, <a href="#I_FIG_58">Fig. 58</a>, the string is shown to be straight, similar
to the string of a common straight flight. This results from having an
equal width in the winders along the wall-string, and, as we have of
necessity an equal width in the risers, the development of the string
is merely a straight piece of board, as in an ordinary straight flight.
In laying out the string, all we have to do is to make <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
a common pitch-board, and, with it as a templet, mark the lines of the treads
and risers on a straight piece of board, as shown at 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</p>

<p>If you can manage to bend the string without kerfing (grooving), it
will be all the better; if not, the kerfs (grooves) must be parallel to
the rise. You can set out with a straight edge, full size, on a rough
platform, just as shown in the diagram; and when the string is bent and
set in place, the risers and winders will have their correct positions.</p>

<p>To bend these strings or otherwise prepare them for fastening against
the wall, perhaps the easiest way is to saw the string with a fine
saw, across the face, making parallel grooves. This method of bending
is called <i>kerfing</i>, above referred to. The kerfs or grooves must be
cut parallel to the lines of the risers, so as to be vertical when the
string is in place. This method, however—handy though it may be—is
not a good one, inasmuch as the saw groove will show more or less in
the finished work.</p>

                          of Wall String for Same.</p>
</div>

<p>Another method is to build up or <i>stave</i> the string. There are several
ways of doing this. In one, comparatively narrow pieces are cut to the
required curve or to portions of it, and are fastened together, edge
to edge, with glue and screws, until the necessary width is obtained
(<a href="#I_FIG_59_60">see Fig. 59</a>). The heading joints may be either
butted or beveled, the latter being stronger, and should be cross-tongued.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_59_60">Fig. 60</a> shows a method that may be followed when a wide
string is required, or a piece curved in the direction of its width is needed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
for any purpose. The pieces are stepped over each other to suit the desired
curve; and though shown square-edged in the figure, they are usually
cut beveled, as then, by reversing them, two may be cut out of a batten.</p>

manner shown in <a href="#I_FIG_61">Fig. 61</a>, by joining up narrow boards edge
to edge at a suitable bevel to give the desired curve. The internal curve is
frequently worked approximately, before gluing up. The numerous joints
incidental to these methods limit their uses to painted or unimportant work.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_62">Fig. 62</a> is shown a wreath-piece or curved portion
of the outside string rising around the cylinder at the half-space. This is formed
by reducing a short piece of string to a veneer between the springings;
bending it upon a cylinder made to fit the plan; then, when it is
secured in position, filling up the back of the veneer with staves
glued across it; and, finally, gluing a piece of canvas over the whole.
The appearance of the wreath-piece after it has been built up and
removed from the cylinder is indicated in <a href="#I_FIG_63">Fig. 63</a>.
The canvas back has been omitted to show the staving; and the counter-wedge key used for
connecting the wreath-piece with the string is shown. The wreath-piece
is, at this stage, ready for marking the outlines of the steps.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_62">Fig. 62</a> also shows the drum or shape around which strings
may be bent, whether the strings are formed of veneers, staved, or kerfed. Another
drum or shape is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_64">Fig. 64</a>. In this, a portion of
a cylinder is formed in the manner clearly indicated; and the string, being set out
on a veneer board sufficiently thin to bend easily, is laid <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
down round the curve, such a number of pieces of like thickness being then added
as will make the required thickness of the string. In working this
method, glue is introduced between the veneers, which are then quickly
strained down to the curved piece with hand screws. A string of almost
any length can be formed in this way, by gluing a few feet at a time,
and when that dries, removing the cylindrical curve and gluing down
more, until the whole is completed. Several other methods will suggest
themselves to the workman, of building up good, solid, circular strings.</p>

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 65. Laying Out<br />Treads and Risers<br />around a Drum.</p>
</div>

<p>One method of laying out the treads and risers around a cylinder or
drum, is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_65">Fig. 65</a>. The line <i>D</i> shows the curve
of the rail. The lines showing treads and risers may be marked off on the cylinder,
or they may be marked off after the veneer is bent around the drum or
cylinder.</p>

<p>There are various methods of making inside cylinders or wells, and of
fastening same to strings. One method is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_66">Fig. 66</a>.
This gives a strong joint when properly made. It will be noticed that the cylinder
is notched out on the back; the two blocks shown at the back of the
offsets are wedges driven in to secure the cylinder in place, and to
drive it up tight to the strings. <a href="#I_FIG_67">Fig. 67</a> shows an 8-inch
well-hole with cylinder complete; also the method of trimming and finishing same.
The cylinder, too, is shown in such a manner that its construction will
be readily understood.</p>

<p>Stairs having a cylindrical or circular opening always require a weight
support underneath them. This support, which is generally made of rough
lumber, is called the <i>carriage</i>, because it is supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to carry any reasonable load that may be placed upon the stairway. <a href="#I_FIG_68">Fig. 68</a>
shows the under side of a half-space stair having a carriage beneath it. The
timbers marked <i>S</i> are of rough stuff, and may be 2-inch by 6-inch or
of greater dimensions. If they are cut to fit the risers and treads,
they will require to be at least 2-inch by 8-inch.</p>

<p>In preparing the rough carriage for the winders, it will be best to
let the back edge of the tread project beyond the back of the riser
so that it forms a ledge as shown under <i>C</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_69">Fig. 69</a>.
Then fix the cross-carriage pieces under the winders, with the back edge about flush
with the backs of risers, securing one end to the well with screws, and
the other to the wall string or the wall. Now cut short pieces, marked
<i>O O</i> (<a href="#I_FIG_68">Fig. 68</a>), and fix them tightly in between the
cross-carriage and the back of the riser as at <i>B B</i> in the section, <a href="#I_FIG_69">Fig. 69</a>.
These carriages should be of 3-inch by 2-inch material. Now get a piece of
wood, 1-inch by 3-inch, and cut pieces <i>C C</i> to fit tightly between
the top back edge of the winders (or the ledge) and the pieces marked
<i>B B</i> in section. This method makes a very sound and strong job of the
winders; and if the stuff is roughly planed, and blocks are glued on
each side of the short cross-pieces <i>O O O</i>, it is next to impossible
for the winders ever to spring or squeak. When the weight is carried in
this manner, the plasterer will have very little trouble in lathing so
that a graceful soffit will be made under the stairs.</p>

<p>Another method of forming a carriage for a stair is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_70">Fig. 70</a>.
This is a peculiar but very handsome stair, inasmuch as the first
and the last four steps are parallel, but the remainder <i>balance</i> or
<i>dance</i>. The treads are numbered in this illustration; and the plan of
the handrail is shown extending from the scroll at the bottom of the
stairs to the landing on the second story. The trimmer <i>T</i> at the top
of the stairs is also shown; and the rough strings or carriages, <i>R S</i>,
<i>R S</i>, <i>R S</i>, are represented by dotted lines.</p>

<p>This plan represents a stair with a curtail step, and a scroll handrail
resting over the curve of the curtail step. This type of stair is not
now much in vogue in this country, though it is adopted occasionally
in some of the larger cities. The use of heavy newel posts instead of
curtail steps, is the prevailing style at present.</p>

<p>In laying out geometrical stairs, the steps are arranged on principles
already described. The well-hole in the center is first laid down
and the steps arranged around it. In circular stairs with an open
well-hole, the handrail being on the inner side, the width of tread for
the steps should be set off at about 18 inches from the handrail, this
giving an approximately uniform rate of progress for anyone ascending
or descending the stairway. In stairs with the rail on the outside, as
sometimes occurs, it will be sufficient if the treads have the proper
width at the middle point of their length.</p>

<p>Where a flight of stairs will likely be subject to great stress and
wear, the carriages should be made much heavier than indicated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the foregoing figures; and there may be cases when it will be necessary
to use iron bolts in the sides of the rough strings in order to give
them greater strength. This necessity, however, will arise only in the
case of stairs built in public buildings, churches, halls, factories,
warehouses, or other buildings of a similar kind. Sometimes, even in
house stairs it may be wise to strengthen the treads and risers by
spiking pieces of board to the rough string, ends up, fitting them
snugly against the under side of the tread and the back of the riser.
The method of doing this is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_71">Fig. 71</a>,
in which the letter <i>O</i> shows the pieces nailed to the string.</p>

<p>The only form of stair not shown which the student may be called upon
to build, would very likely be one having an elliptical plan; but,
as this form is so seldom used—being found, in fact, only in public
buildings or great mansions—it rarely falls to the lot of the ordinary
workman to be called upon to design or construct a stairway of this type.

<p>The construction of wreaths is based on a few geometrical
problems—namely, the projection of straight and curved lines into an
oblique plane; and the finding of the angle of inclination of the plane
into which the lines and curves are projected. This angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is called the <i>bevel</i>, and by its use the wreath is made to twist.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_84">Fig. 84</a> is shown an obtuse-angle plan; in <a href="#I_FIG_85">Fig. 85</a>,
an acute-angle plan; and in <a href="#I_FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>, a semicircle enclosed within straight lines.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><big><b>Projection.</b></big> A knowledge of how to project the lines
and curves in each of these plans into an oblique plane, and to find the angle of
inclination of the plane, will enable the student to construct any and
all kinds of wreaths.</p>

<p>The straight lines <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> in the plan, <a href="#I_FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>,
are known as <i>tangents</i>; and the curve, the <i>central line</i> of the plan wreath.</p>

<p>The straight line across from <i>n</i> to <i>n</i> is the <i>diameter</i>; and the
perpendicular line from it to the lines <i>c</i> and <i>b</i> is the <i>radius</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>tangent</i> line may be defined as a line touching a curve without
cutting it, and is made use of in handrailing to square the joints of
the wreaths.</p>

<div><a name="TANGENT" id="TANGENT"></a>
<h4>Tangent System.</h4></div>

<p>The <i>tangent system</i> of handrailing takes its
name from the use made of the tangents for this purpose.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>, it is shown that the joints connecting the central
line of rail with the plan rails <i>w</i> of the straight flights, are placed right
at the springing; that is, they are in line with the diameter of the
semicircle, and square to the side tangents <i>a</i> and <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The center joint of the crown tangents is shown to be square to
tangents <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. When these lines are projected into an oblique
plane, the joints of the wreaths can be made to butt square by applying
the bevel to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
All handrail wreaths are assumed to rest on an oblique plane while
ascending around a well-hole, either in connecting two flights or in
connecting one flight to a landing, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="space-below1">In the simplest cases of construction, the
wreath rests on an inclined plane that inclines in one direction only,
to either side of the well-hole; while in other cases it rests on a
plane that inclines to two sides.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_87">Fig. 87</a> illustrates what is meant by a plane inclining
in one direction. It will be noticed that the lower part of the figure is a
reproduction of the quadrant enclosed by the tangents <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in
<a href="#I_FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>. The quadrant, <a href="#I_FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>,

tangent <i>a</i> the height of <i>h</i> above the tangent <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_88">Fig. 88</a>, a view of <a href="#I_FIG_87">Fig. 87</a> is given in which
the tangents <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are shown in plan, and also the quadrant representing the plan
central line of a wreath. The curved line extending from <i>a</i> to <i>h</i>
in this figure represents the development of the central line of the
plan wreath, and, as shown, it rests on an oblique plane inclining
to one side only—namely, to the side of the plan tangent <i>a</i>. The
joints are made square to the developed tangents <i>a</i> and <i>m</i> of the
inclined plane; it is for this purpose only that tangents are made use
of in wreath construction. They are shown in the figure to consist of
two lines, <i>a</i> and <i>m</i>, which are two adjoining sides of a developed
section (in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
this case, of a square prism), the section being the
assumed inclined plane whereon the wreath rests in its ascent from <i>a</i>
to <i>h</i>. The joint at <i>h</i>, if made square to the tangent <i>m</i>, will be
a true, square butt-joint; so also will be the joint at <i>a</i>, if made
square to the tangent <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>In practical work it will be required to find the correct geometrical
angle between the two developed tangents <i>a</i> and <i>m</i>; and here, again,
it may be observed that the finding of the correct angle between the
two developed tangents is the essential purpose of every tangent system
of handrailing.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_89">Fig. 89</a> is shown the geometrical solution—the one necessary
to find the angle between the tangents as required on the face-mould to square
the joints of the wreath. The figure is shown to be similar to <a href="#I_FIG_87">Fig. 87</a>,
except that it has an additional portion marked “Section.” This section
is the true shape of the oblique plane whereon the wreath ascends, a
view of which is given in <a href="#I_FIG_88">Fig. 88</a>. It will be observed that
one side of it is the developed tangent <i>m</i>; another side, the developed tangent
<i>a″</i> (= <i>a</i>). The angle between the two as here presented is the one
required on the face-mould to square the joints.</p>

<p>In this example, <a href="#I_FIG_89">Fig. 89</a>, owing to the plane being oblique
in one direction only, the shape of the section is found by merely drawing the
tangent <i>a″</i> at right angles to the tangent <i>m</i>, making it equal in
length to the level tangent <i>a</i> in the plan. By drawing lines parallel
to <i>a″</i> and <i>m</i> respectively, the form of the section will be found,
its outlines being the projections of the plan lines; and the angle
between the two tangents, as already said, is the angle required on the
face-mould to square the joints of the wreath.</p>

<p>The solution here presented will enable the student to find the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
correct direction of the tangents as required on the face-mould to square
joints, in all cases of practical work where one tangent of a wreath is
level and the other tangent is inclined, a condition usually met with
in level-landing stairways.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_90">Fig. 90</a> exhibits a condition of tangents where the two
are equally inclined. The plan here also is taken from <a href="#I_FIG_86">Fig. 86</a>.
The inclination of the tangents is made equal to the inclination of tangent <i>b</i>
in <a href="#I_FIG_86">Fig.86</a>, as shown at <i>m</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_87">Figs. 87</a>,
<a href="#I_FIG_88">88</a>, and <a href="#I_FIG_89">89</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_91">Fig. 91</a>, a view of <a href="#I_FIG_90">Fig. 90</a>
is given, showing clearly the inclination of the tangents <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i>
over and above the plan tangents <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>. The central line of the
wreath is shown extending along the sectional plane, over and above
its plan lines, from one joint to the other, and, at the joints, made
square to the inclined tangents <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i>. It is evident from the
view here given, that the condition necessary to square the joint at
each end would be to find the true angle between the tangents <i>c″</i> and
<i>d″</i>, which would give the correct direction to each tangent.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_92">Fig. 92</a> is shown how to find this angle correctly as
required on the face-mould to square the joints. In this figure is shown the same
plan as in Figs. <a href="#I_FIG_90">90</a> and <a href="#I_FIG_91">91</a>, and the same inclination
to the tangents as in <a href="#I_FIG_90">Fig. 90</a>, so that, except for the portion marked
“Section,” it would be similar to <a href="#I_FIG_90">Fig. 90</a>.</p>

<p>To find the correct angle for the tangents of the face-mould, draw the
line <i>m</i> from <i>d</i>, square to the inclined line of the tangents <i>c′</i>
<i>d″</i>; revolve the bottom inclined tangent <i>c′</i> to cut line <i>m</i> in <i>n</i>,
where the joint is shown fixed; and from this point draw the line <i>c″</i>
to <i>w</i>. The intersection of this line with the upper tangent <i>d″</i> forms
the correct angle as required on the face-mould. By drawing the joints
square to these two lines, they will butt square with the rail that is
to connect <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
with them, or to the joint of another wreath that may belong
to the cylinder or well-hole.</p>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_93">Fig. 93</a> is another view of these tangents in position placed
over and above the plan tangents of the well-hole. It will be observed that
this figure is made up of <a href="#I_FIG_88">Figs. 88</a> and <a href="#I_FIG_91">91</a>
combined. <a href="#I_FIG_88">Fig. 88</a>, as here presented, is shown to
connect with a level-landing rail at <i>a</i>. The joint having been made
square to the level tangent, <i>a</i> will butt square to a square end of
the level rail. The joint at <i>h</i> is shown to connect the two wreaths
and is made square to the inclined <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
tangent <i>m</i> of the lower wreath, and
also square to the inclined tangent <i>c″</i> of the upper wreath; the two
tangents, aligning, guarantee a square butt-joint. The upper joint is
made square to the tangent <i>d″</i>, which is here shown to align with the
rail of the connecting flight; the joint will consequently butt square
to the end of the rail of the flight above.</p>

<p>The view given in this diagram is that of a wreath starting from a
level landing, and winding around a well-hole, connecting the landing
with a flight of stairs leading to a second story. It is presented
to elucidate the use made of tangents to square the joints in wreath
construction. The wreath is shown to be in two sections, one extending
from the level-landing rail at <i>a</i> to a joint in the center of the
well-hole at <i>h</i>, this section having one level tangent <i>a</i> and one
inclined tangent <i>m</i>; the other section is shown to extend from <i>h</i> to
<i>n</i>, where it is butt-jointed to the rail of the flight above.</p>

</div>

<p>This figure clearly shows that the joint at <i>a</i> of the bottom
wreath—owing to the tangent <i>a</i> being level and therefore aligning
with the level rail of the landing—will be a true butt-joint; and
that the joint at <i>h</i>, which connects the two wreaths, will also be a
true butt-joint, owing to it being made square to the tangent <i>m</i> of
the bottom wreath and to the tangent <i>c″</i> of the upper wreath, both
tangents having the same inclination; also the joint at <i>n</i> will butt
square to the rail of the flight above,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>owing to it being made square
to the tangent <i>d″</i>, which is shown to have the same inclination as the
rail of the flight adjoining.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the use made of tangents is to square the joints
of the wreaths; and in this diagram it is clearly shown that the way
they can be made of use is by giving each tangent its true direction.
How to find the true direction, or the angle between the tangents <i>a</i>
and <i>m</i> shown in this diagram, was demonstrated in <a href="#I_FIG_89">Fig. 89</a>;
and how to find the direction of the tangents <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i> was shown

</div>

<p><a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a> is presented to help further toward an understanding
of the tangents. In this diagram they are unfolded; that is, they are
stretched out for the purpose of finding the inclination of each one
over and above the plan tangents. The side plan tangent <i>a</i> is shown
stretched out to the floor line, and its elevation <i>a′</i> is a level
line. The side plan tangent <i>d</i> is also stretched out to the floor
line, as shown by the arc <i>n′ m′</i>. By this process the plan tangents
are now in one straight line on the floor line, as shown from <i>w</i> to
<i>m′</i>. Upon each one, erect a perpendicular line as shown, and from
<i>m′</i> measure to <i>n</i>, the height the wreath is to ascend around the
well-hole. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
practice, the number of risers in the well-hole will
determine this height.</p>

<p>Now, from point <i>n</i>, draw a few treads and risers as shown; and along
the nosing of the steps, draw the pitch-line; continue this line over
the tangents <i>d″</i>, <i>c″</i>, and <i>m</i>, down to where it connects with the
bottom level tangent, as shown. This gives the pitch or inclination
to the tangents over and above the well-hole. The same line is shown
in <a href="#I_FIG_93">Fig. 93</a>, folded around the well-hole, from <i>n</i>, where
it connects with the flight at the upper end of the well-hole, to <i>a</i>, where it
connects with the level-landing rail at the bottom of the well-hole. It
will be observed that the upper portion, from joint <i>n</i> to joint <i>h</i>,
over the tangents <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i>, coincides with the pitch-line of the
same tangents as presented in <a href="#I_FIG_92">Fig. 92</a>, where they are used
to find the true angle between the tangents as it is required on the face-mould to
square the joints of the wreath at <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_89">Fig. 89</a> the same pitch is shown given to tangent <i>m</i>
as in <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>; and in both figures the pitch is shown to be the
same as that over and above the upper connecting tangents <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i>,
which is a necessary condition where a joint, as shown at <i>h</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_93">Figs. 93</a>
and <a href="#I_FIG_94">94</a>, is to connect two pieces of wreath as in this example.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a> are shown the two face-moulds for the wreaths,
placed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
upon the pitch-line of the tangents over the well-hole. The angles between
the tangents of the face-moulds have been found in this figure by the
same method as in <a href="#I_FIG_89">Figs. 89</a> and <a href="#I_FIG_92">92</a>,
which, if compared with the present figure, will be found to correspond, excepting
only the curves of the face-moulds in <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>.</p>

<p>The foregoing explanation of the tangents will give the student a
fairly good idea of the use made of tangents in wreath construction.
The treatment, however, would not be complete if left off at
this point, as it shows how to handle tangents under only two
conditions—namely, first, when one tangent inclines and the other is
level, as at <i>a</i> and <i>m</i>; second, when both tangents incline, as shown
at <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a> is shown a well-hole connecting two flights,
where two portions of unequal pitch occur in both pieces of wreath. The first
piece over the tangents <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is shown to extend from the
square end of the straight rail of the bottom flight, to the joint in
the center of the well-hole, the bottom tangent <i>a″</i> in this wreath
inclining more than the upper tangent <i>b″</i>. The other piece of wreath
is shown to connect with the bottom one at the joint <i>h″</i> in the
center of the well-hole, and to extend over tangents <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i> to
connect with the rail of the upper flight. The relative inclination
of the two tangents in this wreath, is the reverse of that of the two
tangents of the lower wreath. In the lower piece, the bottom tangent
<i>a″</i>, as previously stated, inclines considerably more than does the
upper tangent <i>b″</i>; while in the upper piece, the bottom tangent <i>c″</i>
inclines considerably less than the upper tangent <i>d″</i>.</p>

<p>The question may arise: What causes this? Is it for variation in the
inclination of the tangents over the well-hole? It is simply owing to
the tangents being used in handrailing to square the joints.</p>

<p>The inclination of the bottom tangent <i>a″</i> of the bottom wreath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
is clearly shown in the diagram to be determined by the inclination of the
bottom flight. The joint at <i>a″</i> is made square to both the straight
rail of the flight and to the bottom tangent of the wreath; the rail
and tangent, therefore, must be equally inclined, otherwise the joint
will not be a true butt-joint. The same remarks apply to the joint at
5, where the upper wreath is shown jointed to the straight rail of
the upper flight. In this case, tangent <i>d″</i> must be fixed to incline
conformably to the inclination of the upper rail; otherwise the joint
at 5 will not be a true butt-joint.</p>

</div>

<p>The same principle is applied in determining the pitch or inclination
over the crown tangents <i>b″</i> and <i>c″</i>. Owing to the necessity of
jointing the two wreaths, as shown at <i>h</i>, these two tangents must have
the same inclination, and therefore must be fixed, as shown from 2 to
4, over the crown of the well-hole.</p>

<p>The tangents as here presented are those of the elevation, not of the
face-mould. Tangent <i>a″</i> is the elevation of the side plan tangent
<i>a</i>; tangents <i>b″</i> and <i>c″</i> are shown to be the elevations of the plan
tangents <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>; so, also, is the tangent <i>d″</i> the elevation of
the side plan tangent <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>If this diagram were folded, as <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a> was shown to be in

<p><a href="#I_FIG_96">Fig. 96</a> shows how to find the angle between the

is to span over the first plan quadrant <i>a b</i>. The elevation tangents <i>a″</i>
and <i>b″</i>, as shown, will be the tangents of the mould. To find the
angle between the tangents, draw the line <i>a h</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_96">Fig. 96</a>;
and from <i>a</i>, measure to 2 the length of the bottom tangent <i>a″</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>;
the length from 2 to <i>h</i>, <a href="#I_FIG_96">Fig. 96</a>, will equal the length of the upper

<p>From 2 to 1, measure a distance equal to 2-1 in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>,
the latter being found by dropping a perpendicular from <i>w</i> to meet the tangent
<i>b″</i> extended. Upon 1, erect a perpendicular line; and placing the
dividers on 2, extend to <i>a</i>; turn over to the perpendicular at <i>a″</i>;
connect this point with 2, and the line will be the bottom tangent as
required on the face-mould. The upper tangent will be the line 2-<i>h</i>,
and the angle between the two lines is shown at 2. Make the joint at

<p>The mould as it appears in <a href="#I_FIG_96">Fig. 96</a> is complete,

the joints.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_97">Fig. 97</a> is shown how to find the angle between the
tangents <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i> shown in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>, as required
on the face-mould. On the line <i>h</i>-5, make <i>h</i>-4 equal to the length of the
bottom tangent of the wreath, as shown at <i>h″</i>-4 in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>;
and 4-5 equal to the length of the upper tangent <i>d″</i>. Measure from 4 the distance
shown at 4-6 in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>, and place it from 4 to 6 as shown in

Now place the dividers on 4; extend to <i>h</i>; turn over to cut the

<p>The face-mould, as here presented, will further help toward an
understanding of the layout of face-moulds as shown in Figs. <a href="#I_FIG_96">96</a>
and <a href="#I_FIG_97">97</a>. It will be observed that the pitch of the bottom rail is continued
from <i>a″</i> to <i>b″</i>, a condition caused by the necessity of jointing the
wreath to the end of the straight rail at <i>a″</i>, the joint being made
square to both the straight rail and the bottom tangent <i>a″</i>. From
<i>b″</i> a line is drawn to <i>d″</i>, which is a fixed point determined by the
number of risers in the well-hole. From point <i>d″</i>, the level tangent
<i>d″</i> 5 is drawn in line with the level rail of the landing; thus the
pitch-line of the tangents over the well-hole is found, and, as was
shown in the explanation of <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>, the tangents as here presented
will be those required on the face-mould to square the joints of the wreath.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_98">Fig. 98</a> the tangents of the face-mould for the bottom wreath are
shown to be <i>a″</i> and <i>b″</i>. To place tangent <i>a″</i> in position on the

previously drawn from <i>w</i> square to the tangent <i>b″</i> extended. Then, by
connecting <i>m</i> to <i>b″</i>, the bottom tangent is placed in position on the

<p>The upper piece of wreath in this example is shown to have tangent <i>c″</i>
inclining, the inclination being the same as that of the upper tangent
<i>b″</i> of the bottom wreath, so that the joint at <i>c″</i>, when made square
to both tangents, will butt square when put together. The tangent <i>d″</i>
is shown to be level, so that the joint at 5, when squared with it,
will butt square with the square end of the level-landing rail. The
level tangent is shown revolved to its position on the face-mould,
as from 5 to 2. In this last position, it will be observed that its
angle with the inclined tangent <i>c″</i> is a right angle; and it should
be remembered that in every similar case where one tangent inclines
and one is level over a square-angle plan tangent, the angle between
the two tangents will be a right angle on the face-mould. A knowledge
of this principle will enable the student to draw the mould for this
wreath, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_99">Fig. 99</a>, by merely drawing two lines perpendicular
to each other, as <i>d″</i> 5 and <i>d″ c″</i>, equal respectively to the level
tangent <i>d″</i> 5 and the inclined tangent <i>c″</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>.
The joint at 5 is to be made square to <i>d″</i> 5; and that at <i>c″</i>, to <i>d″ c″</i>. Comparing
this figure with the face-mould as shown for the upper wreath in <a href="#I_FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>,
it will be observed that both are alike.</p>

<p>In practical work the stair-builder is often called upon to deal with
cases in which the conditions of tangents differ from all the examples
thus far given. An instance of this sort is shown in <a href="#I_FIG_100">Fig. 100</a>,
in which the angles between the tangents on the plan are acute.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> In all the
preceding examples, the tangents on the plan were at right angles; that
is, they were square to one another.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_101">Fig. 101</a> is shown how to find the angle between the
tangents on the face-mould that gives them the correct direction for squaring the
joints of the wreath when it is determined to have it ramped. This
figure must be drawn full size. Usually an ordinary drawing-board will
answer the purpose. Upon the board, reproduce the plan of the tangents
and curve of the center line of rail as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_100">Fig. 100</a>.
Measure the height of 5 risers, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>, from the floor
line to 5; and draw the pitch of the flight adjoining the wreath, from 5 to the floor
line. From the newel, draw the dotted line to <i>w</i>, square to the floor
line; from <i>w</i>, draw the line <i>w m</i>, square to the pitch-line <i>b″</i>.
Now take the length of the bottom level tangent on a trammel, or on
dividers if large enough, and extend it from <i>n</i> to <i>m</i>, cutting the
line drawn previously from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<i>w</i>, at <i>m</i>. Connect <i>m</i> to <i>n</i> as shown by
the line <i>a″</i>. The intersection of this line with <i>b″</i> determines the
angle between the two tangents <i>a″</i> and <i>b″</i> of the face-mould, which
gives them the correct direction as required on the face-mould for
squaring the joints. The joint at <i>m</i> is made square to tangent <i>a″</i>;
and the joint at 5, to tangent <i>b″</i>.</p>

Fix point 3 at a height equal to 3 risers from the floor line; at this point
place the pitch-board of the flight to determine the pitch over the curve
as shown from 3 through <i>b″</i> to the floor line. From the newel, draw
a line to <i>w</i>, square to the floor line; and from <i>w</i>, square to the

<p>The wreath in this example follows the nosing line of the steps without

level, while in <a href="#I_FIG_103">Fig. 103</a> it inclines equal to the
pitch of the upper tangent <i>b″</i> and of the flight adjoining. In other words,
the method shown in <a href="#I_FIG_101">Fig. 101</a> is applied to
a construction in which the wreath is ramped; while in <a href="#I_FIG_103">Fig. 103</a>
the method is applicable to a wreath following the nosing line all along
the curve to the newel.</p>

<h4>Bevels to Square the Wreaths.</h4></div>

<p>The next process in the construction of a wreath that the handrailer
will be called upon to perform, is to find the bevels that will, by
being applied to each end of it, give the correct angle to <i>square</i> or
<i>twist</i> it when winding around the well-hole from one flight to another
flight, or from a flight to a landing, as the case may be.</p>

</div>

<p>The wreath is first cut from the plank square to its surface as shown
in <a href="#I_FIG_104">Fig. 104</a>. After the application of the bevels,
it is twisted, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_105">Fig. 105</a>, ready to be
moulded; and when in position, ascending from one end of the curve to the other
end, over the inclined plane of the section around the well-hole, its sides
will be plumb, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_106">Fig. 106</a> at <i>b</i>.
In this figure, as also in <a href="#I_FIG_105">Fig. 105</a>, the wreath <i>a</i>
lies in a horizontal position in which its sides appear to be out of
plumb as much as the bevels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
are out of plumb. In the upper part of the
figure, the wreath <i>b</i> is shown placed in its position upon the plane
of the section, where its sides are seen to be plumb. It is evident, as
shown in the relative position of the wreath in this figure, that, if
the bevel is the correct angle of the plane of the section whereon the
wreath <i>b</i> rests in its ascent over the well-hole, the wreath will in
that case have its sides plumb all along when in position. It is for
this purpose that the bevels are needed.</p>

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 113. Finding Bevel Where Upper Tangent
                      Inclines Less Than Lower One.</p>
</div>

<p>A method of finding the bevels for <i>all wreaths</i> (which is considered
rather difficult) will now be explained:</p>

<p><i>First Case.</i> In <a href="#I_FIG_107">Fig. 107</a> is shown a case
where the bottom tangent of a wreath is inclining, and the top one
level, similar to the top wreath shown in <a href="#I_FIG_98">Fig. 98</a>.
It has already been noted that the plane of the section for this kind
of wreath inclines to one side only; therefore one bevel only will
be required to square it, which is shown at <i>d</i>, <a href="#I_FIG_107">Fig. 107</a>.
A view of this plane is given in <a href="#I_FIG_108">Fig. 108</a>;
and the bevel <i>d</i>, as there shown, indicates the angle of the inclination,
which also is the bevel required to square the end <i>d</i> of the wreath.
The bevel is shown applied to the end of the landing rail in exactly the same
manner in which it is to be applied to the end of the wreath. The true
bevel for this wreath is found at the upper angle of the pitch-board.
At the end <i>a</i>, as already stated, no bevel is required, owing to the
plane inclining in one direction only. <a href="#I_FIG_109">Fig. 109</a>
shows a face-mould and bevel for a wreath with the bottom tangent level and
the top tangent inclining, such as the piece at the bottom connecting with
the landing rail in <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>

                    but with Bottom Tangent Level.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Second Case.</i> It may be required to find the bevels for a wreath
having two equally inclined tangents. An example of this kind also is
shown in <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>, where both the tangents
<i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i> of the upper wreath incline equally. Two bevels are
required in this case, because the plane of the section is inclined in
two directions; but, owing to the inclinations being alike, it follows
that the two will be the same. They are to be applied to both ends of
the wreath, and, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_105">Fig. 105</a>, in the
same direction—namely, toward the inside of the wreath for the bottom end,
and toward the outside for the upper end.</p>

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 116. Finding Bevels<br />for Wreath of Fig. 115.</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_110">Fig. 110</a> the method of finding the bevels is shown.
A line is drawn from <i>w</i> to <i>c″</i>, square to the pitch of the tangents,
and turned over to the ground line at <i>h</i>, which point is connected to
<i>a</i> as shown. The bevel is at <i>h</i>. To show that equal tangents have
equal bevels, the line <i>m</i> is drawn, having the same inclination as
the bottom tangent <i>c″</i>, but in another direction. Place the dividers
on <i>o′</i>, and turn to touch the lines <i>d″</i> and <i>m</i>, as shown by the
semicircle. The line from <i>o′</i> to <i>n</i> is equal to the side plan tangent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<i>w a</i>, and both the bevels here shown are equal to the one already
found. They represent the angle of inclination of the plane whereon the
wreath ascends, a view of which is given in <a href="#I_FIG_111">Fig. 111</a>,
where the plane is shown to incline equally in two directions. At
both ends is shown a section of a rail; and the bevels are applied
to show how, by means of them, the wreath is <i>squared</i> or <i>twisted</i>
when winding around the well-hole and ascending upon the plane of the
section. The view given in this figure will enable the student to
understand the nature of the bevels found in <a href="#I_FIG_110">Fig. 110</a>
for a wreath having two equally inclined tangents; also for all other wreaths of
equally inclined tangents, in that every wreath in such case is assumed
to rest upon an inclined plane in its ascent over the well-hole, the
bevel in every case being the angle of the inclined plane.</p>

                                Tangent Level, Over Acute-Angle Plan.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Third Case.</i> In this example, two unequal tangents are given, the
upper tangent inclining more than the bottom one. The method shown in
<a href="#I_FIG_110">Fig. 110</a> to find the bevels for a wreath with two equal
tangents, is applicable to all conditions of variation in the inclination of the
tangents. In <a href="#I_FIG_112">Fig. 112</a> is shown a case where the upper tangent
<i>d″</i> inclines more than the bottom one <i>c″</i>. The method in all cases is to
continue the line of the upper tangent <i>d″</i>, <a href="#I_FIG_112">Fig. 112</a>, to the ground
line as shown at <i>n</i>; from <i>n</i>, draw a line to <i>a</i>, which will be the
horizontal trace of the plane. Now, from <i>o</i>, draw a line parallel to
<i>a n</i>, as shown from <i>o</i> to <i>d</i>, upon <i>d</i>, erect a perpendicular line
to cut the tangent <i>d″</i>, as shown, at <i>m</i>; and draw the line <i>m u o″</i>.
Make <i>u o″</i> equal to the length of the plan tangent as shown by the arc
from <i>o</i>. Put one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
leg of the dividers on <i>u</i>; extend to touch the upper
tangent <i>d″</i>, and turn over to 1; connect 1 to <i>o″</i>; the bevel at 1 is
to be applied to tangent <i>d″</i>. Again place the dividers on <i>u</i>; extend
to the line <i>h</i>, and turn over to 2 as shown; connect 2 to <i>o″</i>, and
the bevel shown at 2 will be the one to apply to the bottom tangent
<i>c″</i>. It will be observed that the line <i>h</i> represents the bottom
tangent. It is the same length and has the same inclination. An example
of this kind of wreath was shown in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>, where the upper tangent
<i>d″</i> is shown to incline more than the bottom tangent <i>c″</i> in the top
piece extending from <i>h″</i> to 5. Bevel 1, found in <a href="#I_FIG_112">Fig. 112</a>,
is the real bevel for the end 5; and bevel 2, for the end <i>h″</i> of the wreath shown
from <i>h″</i> to 5 in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft">

                 of Plan, <a href="#I_FIG_117">Fig. 117</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Fourth Case.</i> In <a href="#I_FIG_113">Fig. 113</a> is shown how to find
the bevels for a wreath when the upper tangent inclines less than the bottom tangent.
This example is the reverse of the preceding one; it is the condition
of tangents found in the bottom piece of wreath shown in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>.
To find the bevel, continue the upper tangent <i>b″</i> to the ground line, as
shown at <i>n</i>; connect <i>n</i> to <i>a</i>, which will be the horizontal trace
of the plane. From <i>o</i>, draw a line parallel to <i>n a</i>, as shown from
<i>o</i> to <i>d</i>; upon <i>d</i>, erect a perpendicular line to cut the continued
portion of the upper tangent <i>b″</i> in <i>m</i>; from <i>m</i>, draw the line <i>m
u o″</i> across as shown. Now place the dividers on <i>u</i>; extend to touch
the upper tangent, and turn over to 1, connect 1 to <i>o″</i>; the bevel at
1 will be the one to apply to the tangent <i>b″</i> at <i>h</i>, where the two
wreaths are shown connected in <a href="#I_FIG_95">Fig. 95</a>. Again place the dividers on
<i>u</i>; extend to touch the line <i>c</i>; turn over to 2; connect 2 to <i>o″</i>;
the bevel at 2 is to be applied to the bottom tangent <i>a″</i> at the joint
where it is shown to connect with the rail of the flight.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Case.</i> In this case we have two equally inclined tangents over
an obtuse-angle plan. In <a href="#I_FIG_102">Fig. 102</a> is shown a plan
of this kind; and in <a href="#I_FIG_103">Fig. 103</a>, the development of the face-mould.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_114">Fig. 114</a> is shown how to find the bevel.
From <i>a</i>, draw a line to <i>a′</i>, square to the ground line. Place the
dividers on <i>a′</i>; extend to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
touch the pitch of tangents, and turn over
as shown to <i>m</i>; connect <i>m</i> to <i>a</i>. The bevel at <i>m</i> will be the only
one required for this wreath, but it will have to be applied to both
ends, owing to the two tangents being inclined.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Case.</i> In this case we have one tangent inclining and one
tangent level, over an acute-angle plan.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 119. Laying Out Curves on Face-Mould with Pins and String.</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_115">Fig. 115</a> is shown the same plan as in
<a href="#I_FIG_114">Fig. 114</a>; but in this case the
bottom tangent <i>a″</i> is to be a level tangent. Probably this condition
is the most commonly met with in wreath construction at the present
time. A small curve is considered to add to the appearance of the stair
and rail; and consequently it has become almost a “fad” to have a
little curve or stretch-out at the bottom of the stairway, and in most
cases the rail is ramped to intersect the newel at right angles instead
of at the pitch of the flight. In such a case, the bottom tangent <i>a″</i>
will have to be a level tangent, as shown at <i>a″</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_115">Fig. 115</a>,
the pitch of the flight being over the plan tangent <i>b</i> only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
To find the bevels when tangent <i>b″</i> inclines and tangent <i>a″</i> is
level, make <i>a c</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_116">Fig. 116</a> equal to <i>a c</i>
in <a href="#I_FIG_115">Fig. 115</a>. This line will be the base
of the two bevels. Upon <i>a</i>, erect the line <i>a w m</i> at right angles to
<i>a c</i>; make <i>a w</i> equal to <i>o w</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_115">Fig. 115</a>;
connect <i>w</i> and <i>c</i>; the bevel at <i>w</i> will be the one to apply to
tangent <i>b″</i> at <i>n</i> where the wreath is joined to the rail of the
flight. Again, make <i>a m</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_116">Fig. 116</a> equal the
distance shown in <a href="#I_FIG_115">Fig. 115</a> between <i>w</i> and <i>m</i>,
which is the full height over which tangent <i>b″</i> is inclined; connect <i>m</i>
to <i>c</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_116">Fig. 116</a>, and at <i>m</i> is the bevel
to be applied to the level tangent <i>a″</i>.</p>

in <a href="#I_FIG_117">Fig. 117</a>, which is a line drawn square to the inclined tangent <i>b″</i>

<h4>How to Put the Curves on the Face-Mould.</h4></div>

<p>It has been shown how to find the angle between the tangents of
the face-mould, and that the angle is for the purpose of squaring the
joints at the ends of the wreath. In <a href="#I_FIG_119">Fig. 119</a> is shown how
to lay out the curves by means of pins and a string—a very common practice among
stair-builders. In this example the face-mould has equal tangents as
shown at <i>c″</i> and <i>d″</i>. The angle between the two tangents is shown at
<i>m</i> as it will be required on the face-mould. In this figure a line is
drawn from <i>m</i> parallel to the line drawn from <i>h</i>, which is marked in
the diagram as “Directing Ordinate of Section.” The line drawn from <i>m</i>
will contain the minor axes; and a line drawn through the corner of
the section at 3 will contain the major axes of the ellipses that will
constitute the curves of the mould.</p>

<p>The <i>major</i> is to be drawn square to the <i>minor</i>, as shown. Place,
from point 3, the circle shown on the minor, at the same distance as the
circle in the plan is fixed from the point <i>o</i>. The diameter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of this circle indicates the width of the curve at this point The width at each
end is determined by the bevels. The distance <i>a b</i>, as shown upon the
long edge of the bevel, is equal to ½ the width of the mould, and is
the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose base is ½ the width of
the rail. By placing this dimension on each side of <i>n</i>, as shown at
<i>b</i> and <i>b</i>, and on each side of <i>h″</i> on the other end of the mould, as
shown also at <i>b</i> and <i>b</i>, we obtain the points <i>b</i> 2 <i>b</i> on the inside
of the curve, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the points <i>b</i> 1 <i>b</i> on the outside. It will now be
necessary to find the elliptical curves that will contain these points;
and before this can be done, the exact length of the <i>minor</i> and
<i>major</i> axes respectively must be determined. The length of the minor
axis for the inside curve will be the distance shown from 3 to 2; and
its length for the outside will be the distance shown from 3 to 1.</p>

<p>To find the length of the major axis for the inside, take the length of
half the minor for the inside on the dividers: place one leg on <i>b</i>,
extend to cut the major in <i>z</i>, continue to the minor as shown at <i>k</i>.
The distance from <i>b</i> to <i>k</i> will be the length of the semi-major axis
for the inside curve.</p>

<p>To draw the curve, the points or <i>foci</i> where the pins are to be fixed
must be found on the major axis. To find these points, take the length
of <i>b k</i> (which is, as previously found, the exact length of the
semi-major for the inside curve) on the dividers; fix one leg at 2, and
describe the arc <i>Y</i>, cutting the major where the pins are shown fixed,
at <i>o</i> and <i>o</i>. Now take a piece of string long enough to form <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a loop around the two and extending, when tight, to 2, where the pencil is
placed; and, keeping the string tight, sweep the curve from <i>b</i> to <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The same method, for finding the <i>major</i> and <i>foci</i> for the outside
curve, is shown in the diagram. The line drawn from <i>b</i> on the outside

which is a scientific one, may seem a complicated problem; but once it is

<p>The width on the minor and at each end will have to be determined by

In <a href="#I_FIG_120">Fig. 120</a>, the points <i>b</i> at the ends, and
the points in which the circumference of the circle cuts the minor

Now take a flexible lath; bend it to touch <i>b</i>, <i>z</i>, and <i>b</i> for the
inside curve, and <i>b</i>, <i>w</i>, and <i>b</i> for the outside curve. This method
is handy where the curve is comparatively flat, as in the example here
shown; but where the mould has a sharp curvature, as in case of the one
shown in <a href="#I_FIG_101">Fig. 101</a>, the method shown in
<a href="#I_FIG_119">Fig. 119</a> must be adhered to.</p>

<p>With a clear knowledge of the above two methods, the student will be
able to put curves on any mould.</p>

is for the upper wreath, extending from <i>h</i> to <i>n</i> in <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>.

take the lengths of tangents from <a href="#I_FIG_94">Fig. 94</a>, and place them as

<h4>Arrangement of Risers in and around Well-Hole.</h4></div>

<p>An important matter in wreath construction is to have a knowledge of how
to arrange the risers in and around a well-hole. A great deal of labor and
material is saved through it; also a far better appearance to the
finished rail may be secured.</p>

<p>In level-landing stairways, the easiest example is the one shown in
<a href="#I_FIG_123">Fig. 123</a>, in which the radius of the central line of rail
is made equal to one-half the width of a tread. In the diagram the radius is shown
to be 5 inches, and the treads 10 inches. The risers are placed in the
springing, as at <i>a</i> and <i>a</i>. The elevation of the tangents by this
arrangement will be, as shown, one level and one inclined, for each
piece of wreath. When in this position, there is no trouble in finding
the angle of the tangent as required on the face-mould, owing to that
angle, as in every such case, being a right angle, as shown at <i>w</i>;
also no special bevel will have to be found, because the upper bevel of
the pitch-board contains the angle required.</p>

<p>The same results are obtained in the example shown in <a href="#I_FIG_124">Fig. 124</a>,
in which the radius of the well-hole is larger than half the width of a
tread, by placing the riser <i>a</i> at a distance from <i>c</i> equal to half
the width of a tread, instead of at the springing as in the preceding example.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_125">Fig. 125</a> is shown a case where the risers are placed at
a distance from <i>c</i> equal to a full tread, the effect in respect to the tangents
of the face-mould and bevel being the same as in the two preceding
examples. In <a href="#I_FIG_126">Fig. 126</a> is shown the plan
of <a href="#I_FIG_123">Fig. 123</a>; in <a href="#I_FIG_127">Fig. 127</a>,
the plan of <a href="#I_FIG_124">Fig. 124</a>; and in <a href="#I_FIG_128">Fig. 128</a>,
the plan of <a href="#I_FIG_125">Fig. 125</a>. For the
wreaths shown in all these figures, there will be no necessity of
<i>springing</i> the plank, which is a term used in handrailing to denote
the twisting of the wreath; and no other bevel than the one at the
upper end of the pitch-board will be required. This type of wreath,
also, is the one that is required at the top of a landing when the rail
of the flight intersects with a level-landing rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
In <a href="#I_FIG_129">Fig. 129</a> is shown a very simple method of drawing
the face-mould for this wreath from the pitch-board. Make <i>a c</i> equal
to the radius of the plan central line of rail as shown at the curve in
<a href="#I_FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>. From where line <i>c c″</i> cuts the long side
of the pitch-board, the line <i>c″ a″</i> is drawn at right angles to the long edge,
and is made equal to the length of the plan tangent <i>a c</i>, <a href="#I_FIG_130">Fig. 130</a>.
The curve is drawn by means of pins and string or a trammel.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_131">Fig. 131</a> is shown a quarter-turn between
two flights. The correct method of placing the risers in and around
the curve, is to put the last one in the first flight and the first
one in the second flight one-half a step from the intersection of
the crown tangents. By this arrangement, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_132">Fig. 132</a>,
the pitch-line of the tangents will equal the pitch of the connecting
flight, thus securing the second easiest condition of tangents for the
face-mould—namely, as shown, two equal tangents. For this wreath, only
one bevel will be needed, and it is made up of the radius of the plan
central line of the rail <i>o c</i>, <a href="#I_FIG_131">Fig. 131</a>,
for base, and the line 1-2, <a href="#I_FIG_132">Fig. 132</a>, for altitude,
as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_133">Fig. 133</a>.</p>

<p>The bevel shown in this figure has been previously explained in
<a href="#I_FIG_105">Figs. 105</a> and <a href="#I_FIG_106">106</a>.
It is to be applied to both ends of the wreath.</p>

<p>The example shown in <a href="#I_FIG_134">Fig. 134</a> is of a well-hole
having a riser in the center. If the radius of the plan central line
of rail is made equal to one-half a tread, the pitch of tangents will
be the same as of the flights adjoining, thus securing two equal
tangents for the two sections of wreath. In this figure the tangents
of the face-mould are developed, and also the central line of the
rail, as shown over and above each quadrant and upon the pitch-line of
tangents.</p>

<p>The same method may be employed in stairways having obtuse-angle and
acute-angle plans, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_135">Fig. 135</a>, in which
two flights are placed at an obtuse angle to each other. If the risers
shown at <i>a</i> and <i>a</i> are placed one-half a tread from <i>c</i>, this will
produce in the elevation a pitch-line over the tangents equal to that
over the flights adjoining, as shown in <a href="#I_FIG_136">Fig. 136</a>,
in which also is shown the face-mould for the wreath that will span over
the curve from one flight to another.</p>

<p>In <a href="#I_FIG_137">Fig. 137</a> is shown a flight having the same
curve at a landing. The same arrangement is adhered to respecting the placing
of the risers, as shown at <i>a</i> and <i>a</i>. In <a href="#I_FIG_138">Fig. 138</a>

<h2>PART II<br />THE STEEL SQUARE</h2></div>

<h3>Introductory.</h3>

<p>The Standard Steel Square has a <i>blade</i> 24 inches long and 2 inches
wide, and a <i>tongue</i> from 14 to 18 inches long and 1½ inches wide. The
blade is at right angles to the tongue.</p>

<p>The <i>face</i> of the square is shown in <a href="#II_FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>. It is
always stamped with the manufacturer’s name and number.</p>

<p>The reverse is the <i>back</i> (<a href="#II_FIG_2">see Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>The longer arm is the <i>blade</i>; the shorter arm, the <i>tongue</i>.</p>

<p>In the center of the tongue, on the face side, will be found two
parallel lines divided into spaces (<a href="#II_FIG_1">see Fig. 1</a>); this
is the <i>octagon scale</i>.</p>

<p>The spaces will be found numbered 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70, when
the tongue is 18 inches long.</p>

<p>To draw an octagon of 8 inches square, draw an 8 inch square and then
draw a perpendicular and a horizontal line through its center. To find
the length of the octagon side, place one point of a compass on any of
the main divisions of the scale, and the other point of the compass on
the eighth subdivision; then step this length off on each side of the
center lines on the side of the square, which will give the points from
which to draw the octagon lines.</p>

<p>The diameter of the octagon must equal in inches the number of spaces
taken from the square.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the tongue, in the center, will be found the
<i>brace rule</i> (<a href="#II_FIG_3">see Fig. 3</a>). The fractions denote
the <i>rise</i> and <i>run</i> of the brace, and the decimals the <i>length</i>. For
example, a brace of 36 inches run and 36 inches rise, has a length
of 50.91 inches; a brace of 42 inches run and 42 inches rise, has a
length of 59.40 inches; etc.

<p>On the back of the blade (<a href="#II_FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>) will be found
the <i>board measure</i>, where eight parallel lines running along the
length of the blade are shown and divided at every inch by cross-lines.
Under 12, on the outer edge of the blade, will be found the various
lengths of the boards, as 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc. For example, take a
board 14 feet long and 9
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2b" id="Page_2b">[Pg 2]</a></span>inches wide. To find the contents, look under
12, and find 14; then follow this space along to the cross-line under
9, the width of the board; and here is found 10 feet 6 inches, denoting
the contents of a board 14 feet long and 9 inches wide.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_5">Fig. 5</a> is shown a pentagon figure. The miters
of the pentagon stand at 72 degrees with each other, and are
found by dividing 360 by 5, the number of sides in the pentagon.
But the angle when applied to the square to obtain the miter, is
only one-half of 72, or 36 degrees, and intersects the blade at
<small><sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub></small>, as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_6">Fig. 6</a> the same process is used in finding the
miter and side of the hexagon polygon.</p>

<p>To find the degree line, 360 is divided by 6, the number
of sides, as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><big>360 ÷ 6 = 60;&emsp;and&emsp;60 ÷ 2 = 30 degrees.</big></p>

<p>Now, from 12 on tongue, draw a line making an angle of 30 degrees with
the tongue. It will cut the blade in 7 as shown; and from 7 to <i>m</i>, the
heel of the square, will be the length of the side. From 6 on tongue,
erect a line to cut the degree line in <i>c</i>; and with <i>c</i> as center,
describe a circle having the radius of <i>c</i> 7; and around the circle,
complete the hexagon by taking the length 7 <i>m</i> with the compass for

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_7">Fig. 7</a> the same process is shown applied to the
octagon. The degree line in all the polygons is found by dividing 360 by the
number of sides in the figure:</p>

<p class="center"><big>360 ÷ 8 = 45;&emsp;and&emsp;45 ÷ 2 = 22½ degrees.</big></p>

<p>This gives the degree line for the octagon. Complete the process as was
described for the other polygons.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_11">Fig. 11</a> is shown the relative length of

17 inches. The reason, as shown in this diagram, why 17 is taken for
the run of the hip, instead of 12 as for the common rafter, is that
the seats of the common rafter and hip do not run parallel with each
other, but diverge in roofs of equal pitch at an angle of 45 degrees;
therefore, 17 inches taken on the run of the hip is equal to only 12
inches when taken on that of the common rafter, as shown by the dotted
line from heel to heel of the two squares in <a href="#II_FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>.</p>

correspond to the run of the common rafters, will be 13 inches. It will
be observed that the height in each case is 9 inches.</p>

<h3>The Steel Square as Applied in Roof Framing.</h3></div>

<p>Roof framing at present is as simple as it possibly can be, so that
any attempt at a new method would be superfluous. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8b" id="Page_8b">[Pg 8]</a></span>
There may, however,
be a certain way of presenting the subject that will carry with it
almost the weight assigned to a new theory, making what is already
simple still more simple.</p>

<p>The steel square is a mighty factor in roof framing, and without doubt
the greatest tool in practical potency that ever was invented for the
carpenter. With its use the lengths and bevels of every piece of timber
that goes into the construction of the most intricate design of roof,
can easily be obtained, and that with but very little knowledge of lines.</p>

</div>

<p>In roofs of equal pitch, as illustrated in <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>,
the steel square is all that is required if one properly understands how to handle it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9b" id="Page_9b">[Pg 9]</a></span>
What is meant by a <i>pitch</i> of a roof, is the number of inches it rises
to the foot of run.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_15">Fig. 15</a> is shown the steel square with figures
representing the various pitches to the foot of run. For the ½-pitch
roof, the figures as shown, from 12 on tongue to 12 on blade, are those
to be used on the steel square for the common rafter; and for ⅜ pitch,
the figures to be used on the square will be 12 and 9, as shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

                 In Laying Out Timbers of Roofs of Equal Pitch.</p>
</div>

<p>To understand this figure, it is necessary only to keep in mind that
the pitch of a roof is reckoned from the span. Since the run in each
pitch as shown is 12 inches, the span is two times 12 inches, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10b" id="Page_10b">[Pg 10]</a></span>
equals 24 inches; hence, 12 on blade to represent the foot run, and 12
on tongue to represent the rise over ½ the span, will be the figures on
the square for a ½-pitch roof.</p>

<p>For the ⅜ pitch, the figures are shown to be 12 on tongue and 9 on
blade, 9 being ⅜ of the span, 24 inches.</p>

<p>The same rule applies to all the pitches. The ⅙ pitch is shown to
rise 4 inches to the foot of run, because 4 inches is ⅙ of the span,
24 inches, the ⅓ pitch is shown to rise 8 inches to the foot of run,
because 8 inches is ⅓ of the span, 24 inches; etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

                     Pitches to Foot of Run.</p>
</div>

<p>The roof referred to in <a href="#II_FIG_16">Figs. 16</a> and <a href="#II_FIG_17">17</a>
is to rise 9 inches to the foot of run; it is therefore a ⅜-pitch roof.
For all the common rafters, the figures to be used on the square will
be 12 on blade to represent the run, and 9 on tongue to represent the
rise to the foot of run; and for all the hips and valleys, 17 on blade
to represent the run, and 9 on tongue to represent the rise of the roof
to the foot of run.</p>

<p>Why 17 represents the run for all the hips and valleys, will be
understood by examining <a href="#II_FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>, in which
17 is shown to be the diagonal of a foot square.</p>

<p>In equal-pitch roofs the corners are square, and the plan of the hip or
valley will always be a diagonal of a square corner as shown at 1, 2, 3,
and 5 in <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_18">Fig. 18</a> are shown ⅙ pitch, ⅜ pitch and
½ pitch over a square corner. The figures to be used on the square for
the hip, will be 17 for run in each case. For the ⅙ pitch, the figures
to be used would be 17 inches run and 4 inches rise, to correspond
with the 12 inches run and 4 inches rise of the common rafter. For the
⅜ pitch, the figures to be used for hip would be 17 inches run and 9
inches rise, to correspond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11b" id="Page_11b">[Pg 11]</a></span>
with the 12 inches run and 9 inches rise of
the common rafter; and for the ½ pitch, the figures to be used on the
square will be 17 inches run and 12 inches rise, to correspond with the
12 inches run and 12 inches rise of the common rafter.</p>

<p>It will be observed from above, that in all cases where the plan of the
hip or valley is a diagonal of a square, the figures to be used on the
square for run will be 17 inches; and for the rise, whatever the roof
rises to the foot of run. It should also be remembered that this is
the condition in all roofs of equal pitch, where the angle of the hip
or valley is a 45-degree angle, or, in other words, where we have the
diagonal of a square.</p>

<p>It has been shown in <a href="#II_FIG_12">Fig. 12</a> how other figures for
other plan angles may be found; and that in each case the figures for
run vary according to the plan angle of the hip or valley, while the
figure for the height in each case is similar.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a> are shown a variety of runs for common
rafters, but all have the same pitch; they rise 9 inches to the foot of
run. The main <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12b" id="Page_12b">[Pg 12]</a></span>
roof is shown to have a span of 27 feet, which makes the
run of the common rafter 13 feet 6 inches. The run of the front wing
is shown to be 10 feet 4 inches; and the run of the small gable at the
left corner of the front, is shown to be 8 feet.</p>

<p>The diversity exhibited in the runs, and especially the fractional part
of a foot shown in two of them, will afford an opportunity to treat
of the main difficulties in laying out roof timbers in roofs of equal
pitch. Let it be determined to have a rise of 9 inches to the foot
of run; and in this connection it may be well to remember that the
proportional rise to the foot run for roofs of equal pitch makes not
the least difference in the method of treatment.</p>

<p>To lay out the common rafters for the main roof, which has a run of 13
feet 6 inches, proceed as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>.</p>

<p>Take 12 on the blade and 9 on the tongue, and step 13 times along the
rafter timber. This will give the length of rafter for 13 feet of run.
In this example, however, there is another 6 inches of run to cover.
For this additional length, take 6 inches on the blade (it being ½ a
foot run) for run, and take ½ of 9 on the tongue (which is 4½ inches),
and step one time. This, in addition to what has already been found
by stepping 13 times with 12 and 9, will give the full length of the rafter.</p>

<p>The square with 12 on blade and 9 on tongue will give the heel and

<p>Another method of finding the length of rafter for the 6 inches is
shown in <a href="#II_FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>, where the square is shown applied

timber for the plumb cut. Square No. 1 is shown applied
with 12 on blade and 9 on tongue for the length of the 13 feet. Square
from this cut, measure 6 inches, the additional inches in the run; and
to this point move the square, holding it on the side of the rafter
timber with 12 on blade and 9 on tongue, as for a full foot run.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this method is easily adapted to find any
fractional part of a foot in the length of rafters.</p>

<p>In the front gable, <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>, the fractional part
of a foot is 4 inches to be added to 10 feet of run; therefore, in that
case, the line shown measured to 6 inches in <a href="#II_FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>
would measure only 4 inches for the front gable.</p>

<h4>Heel Cut of Common Rafter.</h4></div>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_16">Fig. 16</a> is also shown a method to lay
out the heel cut of a common rafter. The square is shown applied with
12 on blade and 9 on tongue; and from where the 12 on the square
intersects the edge of the rafter timber, a line is drawn square to the
blade as shown by the dotted line from 12 to <i>a</i>. Then the thickness
of the part of the rafter that is to project beyond the plate to hold
the cornice, is gauged to intersect the dotted line at <i>a</i>; and from
<i>a</i>, the heel cut is drawn with the square having 12 on blade and 9 on
tongue, marking along the blade for the cut.</p>

<p>The common rafter for the front wing, which is shown to have a run of
10 feet 4 inches, is laid out precisely the same, except that for this
rafter the square with 12 on blade and 9 on tongue will have to be
stepped along the rafter timber only 10 times for the 10 feet of run;
and for the fractional part of a foot (4 inches) which is in the run,
either of the two methods already shown for the main rafter may be used.</p>

<p>The proportional figures to be used on the square for the 4 inches will
be 4 on blade and 2¼ on tongue; and if the second method is used, make
the addition to the length of rafter for 10 feet, by drawing a line 4
inches square from the tongue of square No. 1 (<a href="#II_FIG_16">see Fig. 16</a>),
instead of 6 inches as there shown for the main rafter.</p>

<div><a name="HIPS" id="HIPS"></a>
<h4>Hips.</h4></div>

<p>Three of the hips are shown in <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a> to
extend from the plate to the ridge-pole; they are marked in the figure
as 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and are shown in plan to be diagonals of
a square measuring 13 feet 6 inches by 13 feet 6 inches; they make an
angle, therefore, of 45 degrees with the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14b" id="Page_14b">[Pg 14]</a></span>
In <a href="#II_FIG_18">Fig. 18</a> it has been shown that a hip
standing at an angle of 45 degrees with the plate will have a run of
17 inches for every foot run of the common rafter. Therefore, to lay
out the hips, the figures on the square will be 17 for run and 9 for
rise; and by stepping 13 times along the hip rafter timber, the length
of hip for 13 feet of run is obtained. The length for the additional 6
inches in the run may be found by squaring a distance of 8½ inches, as
shown in <a href="#II_FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>, from the tongue of the square,
and moving square No. 1 along the edge of the timber, holding the blade
on 17 and tongue on 9, and marking the plumb cut where the dotted line
is shown.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_18">Fig. 18</a> is shown how to find the
relative run length of a portion of a hip to correspond to that of a
fractional part of a foot in the length of the common rafter. From 12
inches, measure along the run of the common rafter 6 inches, and drop
a line to cut the diagonal line in <i>m</i>. From <i>m</i> to <i>a</i>, along the
diagonal line, will be the relative run length of the part of hip to
correspond with 6 inches run of the common rafter, and it measures 8½ inches.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_19">Fig. 19</a> is shown a 12-inch square, the
diagonal <i>m</i> being 17 inches. By drawing lines from the base <i>a b</i> to
cut the diagonal line, the part of the hip to correspond to that of the
common rafter will be indicated on the line 17. In this figure it is
shown that a 6-inch run on <i>a b</i>, which represents the run of a foot of
a common rafter, will have a corresponding length of 8½

<p>In the front gable, <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>, it is shown
that the run of the common rafter is 10 feet 4 inches. To find the
length of the common rafter, take 12 on blade and 9 on tongue, and step
10 times along the rafter timber; and for the fractional part of a foot
(4 inches), proceed as was shown in <a href="#II_FIG_16">Fig. 16</a> for
the rafter of the main roof; but in this case measure out square to the
tongue of square No. 1, 4 inches instead of 6 inches.</p>

<p>In the intersection of this roof with the main roof, there are
shown to be two valleys of different lengths. The long one extends
from the plate at <i>n</i> (<a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>) to the ridge
of the main roof at <i>m</i>; it has therefore <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16b" id="Page_16b">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a run of 13 feet 6 inches.
For the length, proceed as for the hips, by taking 17 on blade of the
square and 9 on tongue, and stepping 13 times for the length of the
13 feet; and for the fractional 6 inches, proceed precisely as shown
in <a href="#II_FIG_17">Fig. 17</a> for the hip, by squaring out from
the tongue of square No. 1, 8½ inches; this, in addition to the length
obtained for the 13 feet, will give the full length of the long valley
<i>n m</i>.</p>

<p>The length of the short valley <i>a c</i>, as shown, extends over the run of
10 feet 4 inches, and butts against the side of the long valley at <i>c</i>.
By taking 17 on blade and 9 on tongue, and stepping along the rafter
timber 10 times, the length for the 10 feet is found; and for the 4
inches, measure 5⅝ inches square from the tongue of square No. 1, in

<h4>How to Treat the Heel Cut of Hips and Valleys.</h4></div>

<p>Having found the lengths of the hips and valleys to correspond to
the common rafters, it will be necessary to find also the thickness of
each above the plate to correspond to the thickness the common rafter
will be above the plate.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_21">Fig. 21</a> is shown a corner of a square
building, showing the plates and the plan lines of a hip. The length
of the hip, as already found, will cover the span from the ridge to
the corner 2; but the sides <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17b" id="Page_17b">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the hip intersect the plates at 3 and
3 respectively; therefore the distance from 2 to 1, as shown in this
diagram, is measured backwards from <i>a</i> to 1 in the manner shown in
<a href="#II_FIG_17">Fig. 17</a>; then a plumb line is drawn through 1 to
<i>m</i>, parallel to the plumb cut <i>a</i>-17. From <i>m</i> to <i>o</i>
on this line, measure the same thickness as that of the common rafter; and
through <i>o</i> draw the heel cut to <i>a</i> as shown.</p>

<p>In like manner the thickness of the valley above the plate
is found; but as the valley as shown in the plan figure,
<a href="#II_FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>, projects beyond point 2 before it
intersects the outside of the plates, the distance from 2 to 1 in the
case of the valley will have to be measured outwards from 2, as shown
from 2 to 1 in <a href="#II_FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>; and at the point thus
found the thickness of the valley is to be measured to correspond with
that of the common rafter as shown at <i>m n</i>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_24">Fig. 24</a> is shown the steel square applied
to a hip or valley timber to cut the bevel that will fit the top end
against the ridge. The figures on the square are 17 and 19¼. The 17
represents the length of the plan line of the hip or valley for a
foot of run, which, as was shown in previous figures, will always be
17 inches in roofs of equal pitch, where the plan lines stand at 45
degrees to the plates and square to each other.</p>

<p>The 19¼ taken on the blade represents the actual length of a hip or
valley that will span over a run of 17 inches. The bevel is marked
along the blade.</p>

<p>The cut across the back of the short valley to fit it against the side
of the long valley, will be a square cut owing to the two plan lines
being at right angles to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18b" id="Page_18b">[Pg 18]</a></span>
In <a href="#II_FIG_25">Fig. 25</a> is shown the steel square
applied to a jack rafter to cut the back bevel, to fit it against the
side of a hip or valley. The figures on the square are 12 on tongue and
15 on blade, the 12 representing a foot run of a common rafter, and the
15 the length of a rafter that will span over a foot run; marking along
the blade will give the bevel.</p>

<p>The rule in every case to find the back bevel for jacks in roofs of
equal pitch, is to take 12 on the tongue to represent the foot run, and
the length of the rafter for a foot of run on the blade, marking along
the blade in each case for the bevel.</p>

<p>In a ½-pitch roof, which is the most common in all parts of the
country, the length of rafter for a foot of run will be 17 inches;
hence it will be well to remember that 12 on tongue and 17 on blade,
marking along the blade, will give the bevel to fit a jack against a
hip or a valley in a ½-pitch roof.</p>

<p>In a roof having a rise of 9 inches to the foot of run, such as the one
under consideration, the length of rafter for one foot of run will be
15 inches. The square as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>, with 12 on
tongue and 15 on blade, will give the bevel by marking along the blade.</p>

<p>To find the length of a rafter for a foot of run for any other pitch,
place the two-foot rule diagonally from 12 on the blade of the square
to the figure on tongue representing the rise of the roof to the foot
of run; the rule will give the length of the rafter that will span over
one foot of run.</p>

</div>

<p>The length of rafter for a foot of run will also determine the
difference in lengths of jacks. For example, if a roof rises 12 inches
to one foot of run, the rafter over this span has been found to be 17
inches; this, therefore, is the number of inches each jack is shortened
in one foot of run. If the rise of the roof is 8 inches to the foot of
run, the length of the rafter is found for one foot of run, by placing
the rule diagonally from 12 on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19b" id="Page_19b">[Pg 19]</a></span>
tongue to 8 on blade, which gives 14½
inches, as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>. This, therefore,
will be the number of inches the jacks are to be shortened in a roof
rising 8 inches to the foot of run. If the jacks are placed 24 inches
from center to center, then multiply 14½ by 2 = 29 inches.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_27">Fig. 27</a> is shown how to find the length
with the steel square. The square is placed on the jack timber rafter
with the figures that have been used to cut the common rafter. In
<a href="#II_FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>, 12 on blade and 12 on tongue were the
figures used to cut the common rafter, the roof being ½ pitch, rising
12 inches to the foot of run. In the diagram it is shown how to find
the length of a jack rafter if placed 16 inches from center to center.
The method is to move the square as shown along the line of
the blade until the blade measures 16 inches; the tongue then would be
as shown from <i>w</i> to <i>m</i>, and the length of the jack would be from 12
on blade to <i>m</i> on tongue, on the edge of the jack rafter timber as shown.</p>

<p>This latter method becomes convenient when the space between jacks is
less than 18 inches; but if used when the space is more than 18 inches
it will become necessary to use two squares; otherwise the tongue as
shown at <i>m</i> would not reach the edge of the timber.</p>

The blade, when in this latter position, will measure 18 inches. The
tongue will meet the edge of the timber at <i>m</i>, and the distance from
<i>m</i> on tongue to 12 on blade will indicate the length of a jack, or, in

</div>

<p>When jacks are placed between hips and valleys as shown at 1, 2,
3, 4, etc., in <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>, a better method of
treatment is shown in <a href="#II_FIG_29">Fig. 29</a>, where the slope
of the roof is projected into the horizontal plane. The distance from
the plate in this figure to the ridge <i>m</i>, equals the length of the
common rafter for the main roof. On the plate <i>a n n</i> is made equal to
<i>a n n</i> in <a href="#II_FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>. By drawing a figure like
this to a scale of one inch to one foot, the length of all the jacks
can be measured <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21b" id="Page_21b">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and also the lengths of the hip and the two valleys. It
also gives the bevels for the jacks, as well as the bevel to fit the
hip and valley against the ridge; but this last bevel must be applied
to the hip and valley when backed.</p>

<p>It has been shown before, that the figures to be used on the square for
this bevel when the timber is left square on back as is the custom in
construction, are the length of a foot run of a hip or valley, which is
17, on tongue, and the length of a hip or valley that will span over 17
inches run, on blade—the blade giving the bevel.</p>

<p><a href="#II_FIG_30">Fig. 30</a> contains all the bevels or cuts
that have been treated upon so far, and, if correctly understood, will
enable any one to frame any roof of equal pitch. In this figure it is
shown that 12 inches run and 9 inches rise will give bevels 1 and 2,
which are the plumb and heel cuts of rafters of a roof rising 9 inches
to the foot of run. By taking these figures, therefore, on the square,
9 inches on the tongue and 12 inches on the blade, marking along the
tongue will give the plumb cut, and marking along the blade will give the heel cut.</p>

<p>Bevels 3 and 4 are the plumb and heel cuts for the hip, and are shown
to have the length of the seat of hip for one foot run, which is 17
inches. By taking 17 inches, therefore, on the blade, and 9 inches on
the tongue, marking along the tongue for the plumb cut, and along the
blade for the heel cut, the plumb and heel cuts are found. Bevel 5,
which is to fit the hip or valley against the ridge when not backed, is
shown from <i>o w</i>, the length of the hip for one foot of run, which is
19¼ inches, and from <i>o s</i>, which always in roofs of equal pitch will
be 17 inches and equal in length to the seat of a hip or valley for one
foot of run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22b" id="Page_22b">[Pg 22]</a></span>
These figures, therefore, taken on the square, 19¼ on the blade, and 17
on the tongue, will give the bevel by marking along the blade as shown
in <a href="#II_FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>, where the square is shown applied
to the hip timber with 19¼ on blade and 17 on tongue, the blade showing
the cut.</p>

<p>Bevels 6 and 7 in <a href="#II_FIG_30">Fig. 30</a> are shown formed
of the length of the rafter for one foot of run, which is 15 inches,
and the run of the rafter, which is 12 inches. These figures are
applied on the square, as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>,
to a jack rafter timber; taking 15 on the blade and 12 on the tongue,
marking along the blade will give the back bevel for the jack rafters,
and marking along the tongue will give the face cut of roof-boards to
fit along the hip or valley.</p>

<p>It is shown in <a href="#II_FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>, also, that by taking the length
of rafter 15 inches on blade, and rise of roof 9 inches on tongue, bevel 8 will give
the miter cut for the roof-boards.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_33">Fig. 33</a> the square is shown applied to
a roof-board with 15 on blade, which is the length of the rafter to
one foot of run, and with 9 on tongue, which is the rise of the roof

<p>Other uses may be made of these figures, as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_34">Fig. 34</a>,
which is one-half of a gable of a roof rising 9 inches to the foot run.
The squares at the bottom and the top will give the plumb and heel cuts
of the common rafter. The same figures on the square applied to the
studding, marking along the tongue for the cut, will give the bevel to
fit the studding against the rafter; and by marking along the blade
we obtain the cut for the boards that run across the gable. By taking
19¼ on blade, which is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23b" id="Page_23b">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the length of the hip for one foot of run, and
taking on the tongue the rise of the roof to the foot of run, which is
9 inches, and applying these as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_35">Fig. 35</a>,
we obtain the backing of the hip by marking along the tongue of the two
squares, as shown.</p>

<p>It will be observed from what has been said, that in roofs of equal
pitch the figure 12 on the blade, and whatever number of inches the
roof rises to the foot run on the tongue, will give the plumb and heel
cuts for the common rafter; and that by taking 17 on the blade instead
of 12, and taking on the tongue the figure representing the rise of the
roof to the foot run, the plumb and heel cuts are found for the hips
and valleys.</p>

<p>By taking the length of the common rafter for one foot of run on blade,
and the run 12 on tongue, marking along the blade will give the back
bevel for the jack to fit the hip or valley, and marking along the
tongue will give the bevel to cut the roof-boards to fit the line of
hip or valley upon the roof.</p>

<p>With this knowledge of what figures to use, and why they are used,
it will be an easy matter for anyone to lay out all rafters for
equal-pitch roofs.</p>

    <p class="center space-below1">Fig. 36. Laying Out Timbers of Roof with Two UnequalPitches.</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a> is shown a plan of a roof with
two unequal pitches. The main roof is shown to have a rise of 12 inches
to the foot run. The front wing is shown to have a run of 6 feet and
to rise 12 feet; it has thus a pitch of 24 inches to the foot run.
Therefore 12 on blade of the square and 12 on tongue will give the
plumb and heel cuts for the main roof, and by stepping 12 times along
the rafter timber the length of the rafter is found. The figures on
the square to find the heel and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24b" id="Page_24b">[Pg 24]</a></span>
plumb cuts for the rafter in the front
wing, will be 12 run and 24 rise, and by stepping 6 times (the number
of feet in the run of the rafter), the length will be found over the
run of 6 feet, and it will measure 13 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>If, in place of stepping along the timber, the diagonal of 12 and 24 is
multiplied by 6, the number of feet in the run, the length may be found
even to a greater exactitude.</p>

<p>Many carpenters use this method of framing; and to those who have
confidence in their ability to figure correctly, it is a saving of
time, and, as before said, will result in a more accurate measurement;
but the better and more scientific method of framing is to work to a
scale of one inch, as has already been explained.</p>

</div>

<p>According to that method, the diagonal of a foot of run, and the number
of inches to the foot run the roof is rising, measured to a scale, will
give the exact length. For example, the main roof in <a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>
is rising 12 inches to a foot of run. The diagonal of 12 and 12 is 17
inches, which, considered as a scale of one inch to a foot, will give
17 feet, and this will be the exact length of the rafter for a roof
rising 12 inches to the foot run and having a run of 12 feet.</p>

</div>

<p>The length of the rafter for the front wing, which has a run of 6 feet
and a rise of 12 feet, may be obtained by placing the rule as shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25b" id="Page_25b">[Pg 25]</a></span> in
<a href="#II_FIG_37">Fig. 37</a> from 6 on blade to 12 on tongue, which
will give a length of 13½ inches. If the scale be considered as one
inch to a foot, this will equal 13 feet 6 inches, which will be the
exact length of a common rafter rising 24 inches to the foot run and
having a run of 6 feet.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the plan lines of the valleys in this figure
in respect to one another deviate from forming a right angle. In
equal-pitch roofs the plan lines are always at right angles to each
other, and therefore the diagonal of 12 and 12, which is 17 inches,
will be the relative foot run of valleys and hips in equal-pitch roofs.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a> is shown how to find the figures
to use on the square for valleys and hips when deviating from the right
angle. A line is drawn at a distance of 12 inches from the plate and
parallel to it, cutting the valley in <i>m</i> as shown. The part of the
valley from <i>m</i> to the plate will measure 13½ inches, which is the figure
that is to be used on the square to obtain the length and cuts of the valleys.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that this equals the length of the common rafter as
found by the square and rule in <a href="#II_FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>. In that
figure is shown 12 on tongue and 6 on blade. The 12 here represents
the rise, and the 6 the run of the front roof. If the 12 be taken to
represent the run of the main roof, and the 6 to represent the run of
the front roof, then, the diagonal 13½ will indicate the length of the
seat of the valley for 12 feet of run, and therefore for one foot it
will be 13½ inches. Now, by taking 13½ on the blade for run, and 12
inches on the tongue for rise, and stepping along the valley rafter
timber 12 times, the length of the valley will be found. The blade will
give the heel cut, and the tongue the plumb cut.</p>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_38">Fig. 38</a> is shown the slope of the roof
projected into the horizontal plane. By drawing a figure based on a
scale of one inch to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26b" id="Page_26b">[Pg 26]</a></span>
foot, all the timbers on the slope of the roof
can be measured. Bevel 2, shown in this figure, is to fit the valleys
against the ridge. By drawing a line from <i>w</i> square to the seat of
the valley to <i>m</i>, making <i>w</i> 2 equal in length to the length of the
valley, as shown, and by connecting 2 and <i>m</i>, the bevel at 2 is found,
which will fit the valleys against the ridge, as shown at 3 and 3 in
<a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#II_FIG_39">Fig. 39</a>, is shown how to find the length and cuts of octagon hips
intersecting a roof. In <a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>, half the plan of the octagon is shown
to be inside of the plate, and the hips <i>o</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>o</i> intersect the
slope of the roof. In <a href="#II_FIG_39">Fig. 39</a>, the lines below <i>x y</i> are the plan
lines; and those above, the elevation. From <i>z</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>o</i>, in the plan,
draw lines to <i>x y</i>, as shown from <i>o</i> to <i>m</i> and from <i>z</i> to <i>m</i>; from
<i>m</i> and <i>m</i>, draw the elevation lines to the apex <i>o″</i>, intersecting
the line of the roof in <i>d″</i> and <i>c″</i>. From <i>d″</i> and <i>c″</i>, draw the
lines <i>d″ v″</i> and <i>c″ a″</i> parallel to <i>x y</i>; from <i>c″</i>, drop a line to
intersect the plan line <i>a o</i> in <i>c</i>. Make <i>a w</i> equal in length to <i>a″
o″</i> of the elevation, and connect <i>w c</i>; measure from <i>w</i> to <i>n</i> the
full height of the octagon as shown from <i>x y</i> to the apex <i>o″</i>; and
connect <i>c n</i>. The length from <i>w</i> to <i>c</i> is that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27b" id="Page_27b">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the two hips shown
at <i>o o</i> in <a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>, both being equal hips intersecting the
roof at an equal distance from the plate. The bevel at <i>w</i> is the top bevel, and
the bevel at <i>c</i> will fit the roof.</p>

<p>Again, drop a line from <i>d″</i> to intersect the plan line <i>a z</i> in
<i>d</i>. Make <i>a</i> 2 equal to <i>v″ o″</i> in the elevation, and connect 2 <i>d</i>.
Measure from 2 to <i>b</i> the full height of the tower as shown from <i>x y</i>
to the apex <i>o″</i> in the elevation, and connect <i>d b</i>. The length 2 <i>d</i>
represents the length of the hip <i>z</i> shown in <a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>;
the bevel at 2 is that of the top; and the bevel at <i>d</i>, the
one that will fit the foot of the hip to the intersecting roof.</p>

<p>When a cornice of any considerable width runs around a roof of this
kind, it affects the plates and the angle of the valleys as shown in
<a href="#II_FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>. In this figure are shown the same
valleys as in <a href="#II_FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>; but, owing to the width of
the cornice, the foot of each has been moved the distance <i>a b</i> along
the plate of the main roof. Why this is done is shown in the drawing to
be caused by the necessity for the valleys to intersect the corners <i>c
c</i> of the cornice.</p>

<p>The plates are also affected as shown in <a href="#II_FIG_41">Fig. 41</a>,
where the plate of the narrow roof is shown to be much higher than the plate
of the main roof.</p>

<p>The bevels shown at 3, <a href="#II_FIG_40">Fig. 40</a>, are to fit the
valleys against the ridge.</p>
